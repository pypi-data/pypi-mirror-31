Hash (unicode) strings to emoji(s). You can set the length.

Importing is as easy as `from pymojihash import hash_to_emoji`!
`hash_to_emoji()` is the wonderful hashing function.

In this example a string is hashed to a single emoji:
    >>> hash_to_emoji('lol')
    '🇫🇲'

There is a limited number of emojis outputs (see: `emojis.json` in this package) so if you increase the `hash_length` the less likely youa re to encounter different values which produce the same output/hash/emoji(s):
    >>> hash_to_emoji('lol', 4)
    '◼️🍕🍐🇫🇲'
    >>> hash_to_emoji('lol', 2)
    '🍐🇫🇲'
    >>> hash_to_emoji('heck', 2)
    '♠️🇨🇦'
