        Quark: a Sphinx theme for QTextBrowser
        ========================================
        
        About
        =====
        
        Quark is a Sphinx theme specifically designed to look and work well within the
        limitations of the Qt toolkit's ``QTextBrowser``.
        
        This theme was originally designed for the bundled manual of `SpeedCrunch`_.
        
        .. _SpeedCrunch: http://speedcrunch.org
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * ``pip install quark-sphinx-theme``
        * In your ``conf.py``::
        
            import quark_sphinx_theme
            html_theme_path = [quark_sphinx_theme.get_path()]
            html_theme = 'quark'
            # To enable more QTextBrowser-compatible HTML generation:
            extensions = ['quark_sphinx_theme.ext.html_rewrite']
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.5.1 *(2018-04-30)*
        
          - Sphinx 1.7 compatibility:
        
            - An internal refactoring broke the integration tests. This has been fixed.
        
          - Every commit is now tested on every supported Python and Sphinx version
            using Gitlab CI.
          - The entire test suite is regularly re-run with the latest Sphinx version to
            more consistently discover compatibility issues.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.5.0 *(2017-06-05)*
        
          - Sphinx 1.6 compatibility:
        
            - A change in Sphinx's HTML code broke the HTML rewriting extensions (see
              issue #1).
            - A change in the ``css_files`` variable in the basic theme's template broke
              the ``extra_css_files`` theme setting.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.4.1 *(2016-11-22)*
        
          - Fix ``python_requires`` in setup.py.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.4 *(2016-10-18)*
        
          - Add an explicit dependency on Sphinx.
          - Rename ``quark_html_rewrite_features`` to ``quark_html_features``.
          - Add ``quark_html_disabled_features`` to explicitly turn off certain rewrite
            features.
          - Style changes:
        
            - More visually appealing code blocks on full browsers.
            - Add styling for compact lists produced by ``::hlist`` directive.
            - Correctly set width for topic blocks.
            - Clean up definition list margins.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.3.2 "I'll get it right some day" *(2016-05-23)*
        
          - Include a copy of the lovelace style for compatibility with Pygments < 2.1.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.3.1 *(2016-05-23)*
        
          - Skip CSS syntax tests if tinycss isn't available.
          - Make sure to include theme itself.
          - Include test/util.py in source packages.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.3 *(2016-05-22)*
        
          - Remove ``hide_sidebar_in_index`` option.
          - Fix styling of index pages.
          - The ``quark_sphinx_theme.ext.html_compat`` extension has been renamed to
            ``quark_sphinx_theme.ext.html_rewrite``. The old name remains supported for
            backwards compatibility.
          - The ``html_rewrite`` extension now supports wrapping admonitions in tables,
            allowing for more styling options. The theme has been updated to take
            advantage of this. Admonitions, topics, and sidebars look very different and
            much better. If ``html_rewrite`` is not enabled, a fallback style will be
            used for these.
          - ``html_rewrite`` supports wrapping literal blocks in tables. If enabled,
            this provides better styling for Pygments styles with non-white backgrounds.
          - Smaller design changes:
        
            - Don't use background color on code elements in headings and normal links.
            - Display terms in definition lists in bold.
            - Remove left and top margins for definition list bodies.
            - Switch default code color scheme to 'lovelace'.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.2.1 *(2016-03-02)*
        
          - Change license to 2-clause BSD (in practice, it's the same thing).
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.2.0 *(2016-02-28)*
        
          - Add ``quark_sphinx_theme.ext.html_compat`` extension.
          - Add styling for citations, footnotes, table captions, and ``rubric``
            directives.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.1.2 *(2016-02-27)*
        
          - Fix compatibility with Jinja2 2.3.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.1.1 *(2016-02-24)*
        
          - Fix spacing of navigation links.
        
        * quark-sphinx-theme 0.1.0 *(2016-02-24)*
