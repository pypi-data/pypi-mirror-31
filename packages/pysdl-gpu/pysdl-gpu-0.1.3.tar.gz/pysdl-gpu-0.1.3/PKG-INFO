Description: pysdl-gpu
        =========
        
        pysdl-gpu is a wrapper around the SDL_gpu library. It depends on PySDL2,
        and it uses ctypes.
        
        The SDL_gpu library, as well as its documentation, can be found here:
        https://github.com/grimfang4/sdl-gpu
        
        Feel free to report bugs or make pull requests here:
        https://bitbucket.org/Jjp137/pysdl-gpu
        
        Note that this library is intended to match the sdl_gpu.h header as closely
        as possible, and thus, following PEP-8 is less of a priority.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        pysdl-gpu requires SDL2 and SDL_gpu to be installed on your system.
        Alternatively, the environment variable ``PYSDL2_DLL_PATH`` can be used to
        point pysdl-gpu to the location of the SDL2 and SDL_gpu libraries.
        
        Once installed, simply import the library::
        
            import sdlgpu
        
        Refer to SDL_gpu's documentation for a list of available functions, enums,
        and structures.
