Description: Saigon
        ============
        
        Saigon is an **experimental** package for use with Angular and SCSS. It contains many useful tools for faster and more efficient developing. The code is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/integree/saigon>`_. 
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Saigon requires AngularJS 1.5.11 or newer and SCSS.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install saigon, run the following command inside this directory::
        
            python setup.py install
            
        You can also install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available to other users of the package on your system::
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        If you have the Python **easy_install** utility available, you can also type 
        the following to download and install in one step::
        
            easy_install saigon
        
        Or if you're using **pip**::
        
            pip install bir-api
        
        To install saigon from SVN directly::
        
            pip install -e svn+http://example.com/svn/saigon/trunk#egg=saigon
            
        or, if you need install from branch::
            
            pip install -e svn+http://example.com/svn/saigon/branches/dev_0_2#egg=saigon
        
        Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included "saigon" directory 
        somewhere on your python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python 
        path.
