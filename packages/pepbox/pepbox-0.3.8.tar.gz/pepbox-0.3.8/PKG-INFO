           <p>
        
        T cell activation that leads to a productive T-cell reaction against a
        pathogen agent is linked to its T cell receptor (TCR) specificity. The
        ability of the TCR to distinguish between structurally unrelated to
        similar peptides defines the T cell specificity. The affinity drives the
        specifcity. A T cell that binds to peptide-MHC complex with enough
        affinity will increase the magnitude of the immune response (i.e. T cell
        expansion). Therefore, expansion is a powerful feature to measure TCRs
        specifity. This application has the goal to quantify if T cell
        clonotypes (i.e. group of T cells sharing the same TCR) are
        significantly expanded by comparing their respective frequency before
        and after contact with a peptide. To improve performance of peptide
        specific clonotypes selection, irrelevant peptide stimulated cultured T
        cells or/and medium cultured T cells can be provided as negative
        controls. A list of reference TCRs known to be specific to the relevant
        peptide (e.g. obtained from tetramer staining, IFNg capture) are used to
        define optimal expansion thresholds for selecting positively and
        negatively expanded T cells
