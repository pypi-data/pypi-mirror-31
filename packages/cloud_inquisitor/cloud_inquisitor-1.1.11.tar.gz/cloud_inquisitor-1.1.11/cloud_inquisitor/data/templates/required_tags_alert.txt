The following instances are not compliant with the Required Tagging standards:
{% for issue in issues %}
    *Account:* `{{ issue.instance.account.account_name }}`
    *Region:* `{{ issue.instance.location }}`
    *Instance ID:* `{{ issue.instance.get_name_or_instance_id(True) }}`
    *Missing Tags:* {{ issue.missing_tags | slack_quote_join }}
    *Notes:* {{ issue.notes | slack_quote_join }}
    *Status:* `{{ issue.state_name() }}`

{% endfor %}
Instances that are not tagged appropriately within a month of being detected as non-compliant *will be shutdown automatically* until tags have been added. To prevent this from happening have the owners of the instances to tag their assets correctly.
