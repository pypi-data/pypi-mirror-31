# Wagtail Gridder

Wagtail Gridder is a Bootstrap 4 enabled layout for the Wagtail CMS. Grid Items are created within categories, and displayed on a Grid Index Page. The JavaScript libraries Gridder and MixItUp are included.

# Requirements

* Django >= 1.9
* Wagtail >= 1.9 (for ParentalManyToMany)
* Bootstrap >= 3 (optimized for Bootstrap 4; templates can be modified)

# Installation

    pip install wagtailgridder

# Settings

    WAGTAILGRIDDER_CLEAR_CACHE = False

The default Wagtail Gridder template caches the grid display area to reduce the number of queries performed. Setting `WAGTAILGRIDDER_CLEAR_CACHE = True` in your Django settings will clear the **entire** Django cache after a page is edited. This approach is necessary, as Django does not currently support deletion from the cache by pattern. Setting this to `True` will clear your cache every time you save a Wagtail page. If anyone knows of a better solution that works for Django's supported cache systems, please let us know!
