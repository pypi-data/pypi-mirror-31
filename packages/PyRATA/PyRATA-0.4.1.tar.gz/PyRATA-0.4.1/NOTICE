This product derives some code from the Gui Guan's implementation of the Thompson's algorithm. 
The original implementation of Gui Guan can be found here "A Beautiful Linear Time Python Regex Matcher via NFA", August 19, 2014 https://www.guiguan.net/a-beautiful-linear-time-python-regex-matcher-via-nfa
The algorithm is described in Thompson, K. (1968). Programming techniques: Regular expression search algorithm. Commun. ACM, 11(6):419â€“422, June.
Gui Guan first wrote this code mainly for educational purpose. Everyone was free to modify it in any way. Eventually he released it under the MIT License.
