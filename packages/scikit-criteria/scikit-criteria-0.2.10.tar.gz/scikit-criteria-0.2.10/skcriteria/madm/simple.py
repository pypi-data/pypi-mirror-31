class WeightedSum(DecisionMaker):
    r"""The weighted sum model (WSM) is the best known and simplest
    multi-criteria decision analysis for evaluating a number of alternatives
    in terms of a number of decision criteria. It is very important to state
    here that it is applicable only when all the data are expressed in exactly
    the same unit. If this is not the case, then the final result is equivalent
    to "adding apples and oranges." To avoid this problem a previous
    normalization step is necesary.

    In general, suppose that a given MCDA problem is defined on :math:`m`
    alternatives and :math:`n` decision criteria. Furthermore, let us assume
    that all the criteria are benefit criteria, that is, the higher the values
    are, the better it is. Next suppose that :math:`w_j` denotes the relative
    weight of importance of the criterion :math:`C_j` and :math:`a_{ij}` is
    the performance value of alternative :math:`A_i` when it is evaluated in
    terms of criterion :math:`C_j`. Then, the total (i.e., when all the
    criteria are considered simultaneously) importance of alternative
    :math:`A_i`, denoted as :math:`A_{i}^{WSM-score}`, is defined as follows:

    .. math::

        A_{i}^{WSM-score} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j a_{ij},\ for\ i = 1,2,3,...,m

    For the maximization case, the best alternative is the one that yields
    the maximum total performance value.

    Notes
    -----

    If some criteria is for minimization, this implementation calculates the
    inverse.

class WeightedProduct(DecisionMaker):
    """The weighted product model (WPM) is a popular multi-criteria decision
    analysis method. It is similar to the weighted sum model.
    The main difference is that instead of addition in the main mathematical
    operation now there is multiplication.

    In general, suppose that a given MCDA problem is defined on :math:`m`
    alternatives and :math:`n` decision criteria. Furthermore, let us assume
    that all the criteria are benefit criteria, that is, the higher the values
    are, the better it is. Next suppose that :math:`w_j` denotes the relative
    weight of importance of the criterion :math:`C_j` and :math:`a_{ij}` is
    the performance value of alternative :math:`A_i` when it is evaluated in
    terms of criterion :math:`C_j`. Then, the total (i.e., when all the
    criteria are considered simultaneously) importance of alternative
    :math:`A_i`, denoted as :math:`A_{i}^{WPM-score}`, is defined as follows:

    .. math::

        A_{i}^{WPM-score} = \prod_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}^{w_j},\ for\ i = 1,2,3,...,m

    To avoid underflow, instead the multiplication of the values we add the
    logarithms of the values; so :math:`A_{i}^{WPM-score}`, is finally defined
    as:

    .. math::

        A_{i}^{WPM-score} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j \log(a_{ij}),\
                            for\ i = 1,2,3,...,m

    For the maximization case, the best alternative is the one that yields
    the maximum total performance value.

    Notes
    -----

    The implementation works as follow:

    - If we have some values of any criteria < 0 in the alternative-matrix
      we add the minimimun value of this criteria to all the criteria.
    - If we have some 0 in some criteria all the criteria is incremented by 1.
    - If some criteria is for minimization, this implementation calculates the
      inverse.
    - Instead the multiplication of the values we add the
      logarithms of the values to avoid underflow.


    Parameters
    ----------

    mnorm : string, callable, optional (default="sum")
        Normalization method for the alternative matrix.

    wnorm : string, callable, optional (default="sum")
        Normalization method for the weights array.
