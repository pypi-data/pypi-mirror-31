class TOPSIS(DecisionMaker):
    """TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have
    the shortest geometric distance from the ideal solution
    and the longest euclidean distance from the worst solution.

    An assumption of TOPSIS is that the criteria are monotonically increasing
    or decreasing, and also allow trade-offs between criteria, where a poor
    result in one criterion can be negated by a good result in another
    criterion.

    Parameters
    ----------

    mnorm : string, callable, optional (default="vector")
        Normalization method for the alternative matrix.

    wnorm : string, callable, optional (default="sum")
        Normalization method for the weights array.

    Returns
    -------

    Decision : :py:class:`skcriteria.madm.Decision`
        With values:

        - **kernel_**: None
        - **rank_**: A ranking (start at 1) where the i-nth element represent
          the position of the i-nth alternative.
        - **best_alternative_**: The index of the best alternative.
        - **alpha_solution_**: True
        - **beta_solution_**: False
        - **gamma_solution_**: True
        - **e_**: Particular data created by this method.

          - **e_.closeness**: Array where the i-nth element represent the
            closenees of the i-nth alternative to ideal and worst solution.
