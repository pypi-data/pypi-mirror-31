__doc__ = """ELECTRE is a family of multi-criteria decision analysis methods
that originated in Europe in the mid-1960s. The acronym ELECTRE stands for:
ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELimination and Choice Expressing
REality).

Usually the Electre Methods are used to discard some alternatives to the
problem, which are unacceptable. After that we can use another MCDA to select
the best one. The Advantage of using the Electre Methods before is that we
can apply another MCDA with a restricted set of alternatives saving much time.

class ELECTRE1(DecisionMaker):
    """The ELECTRE I model  find the kernel solution in a situation where true
    criteria and restricted outranking relations are given.

    That is, ELECTRE I cannot derive the ranking of alternatives but the kernel
    set. In ELECTRE I, two indices called the concordance index and the
    discordance index are used to measure the relations between objects.

    Parameters
    ----------

    p : float, optional (default=0.65)
        Concordance threshold. Threshold of how much one alternative is at
        least as good as another to be significative.

    q : float, optional (default=0.35)
        Discordance threshold. Threshold of how much the degree one alternative
        is strictly preferred to another to be significative.

    mnorm : string, callable, optional (default="sum")
        Normalization method for the alternative matrix.

    wnorm : string, callable, optional (default="sum")
        Normalization method for the weights array.

    njobs : int, default=None
        How many cores to use to solve the linear programs and the second
        method. By default all the availables cores are used.

    Returns
    -------

    Decision : :py:class:`skcriteria.madm.Decision`
        With values:

        - **kernel_**:  Array with the indexes of the alternatives

        - **best_alternative_**: None
        - **alpha_solution_**: False
        - **beta_solution_**: True
        - **gamma_solution_**: False
        - **e_**: Particular data created by this method.

          - **e_.closeness**: Array where the i-nth element represent the
            closenees of the i-nth alternative to ideal and worst solution.
          - **e_.outrank**: numpy.ndarray of bool
            The outranking matrix of superation. If the element[i][j] is True
            The alternative ``i`` outrank the alternative ``j``.
          - **e_.mtx_concordance**: numpy.ndarray
            The concordance indexes matrix where the element[i][j] measures how
            much the alternative ``i`` is at least as good as ``j``.
          - **e_.mtx_discordance**: numpy.ndarray
            The discordance indexes matrix where the element[i][j] measures the
            degree to which the alternative ``i`` is strictly
            preferred to ``j``.
          - **e_.p**: float
            Concordance index threshold.
          - **e_.q**: float
            Discordance index threshold.
