Helper functions, utilities and Docker images for SciLifeLab long-term
support (lts) workflows. 

Features
--------

This repository serves as the main entry point for lts workflows. It
does not provide any workflow code /per se/, but rather the following:

- `pytest`_ wrappers for setting up tests
- base `Docker`_ image for creating workflow images
- general `docs`_ that apply to all lts workflows

For more information, see the `docs`_.
