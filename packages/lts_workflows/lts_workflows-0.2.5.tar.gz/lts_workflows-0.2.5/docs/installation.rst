Stable release
--------------

To install lts-workflows, run this command in your terminal:

.. warning:: WIP: as of yet there is no scilifelab-lts channel. 

.. code-block:: console

    $ # conda install -c scilifelab-lts lts-workflows
    $ conda install -c percyfal lts-workflows

This is the preferred method to install lts-workflows, as it will
always install the most recent stable release.

.. _installation-from-sources:

From sources
------------

The sources for lts-workflows can be downloaded from the `Bitbucket repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:scilifelab-lts/lts-workflows.git

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


    
.. _Bitbucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/scilifelab-lts/lts-workflows
