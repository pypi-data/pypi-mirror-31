Developer guide
===============

Summary
----------

- use the issue tracker
- create feature branches and submit pull requests


Setting up a local copy
-------------------------

See installation section :ref:`installation-from-sources`.

Branching/development model
----------------------------

The development model is based on a stable *master* branch and an
unstable *develop* branch. The *master* branch should be used in
production. Pushing to master/develop has been disabled; only pull
requests from feature branches are permitted.

`Vincent Driessen's branching model`_ provides a good model for
organizing the development process, and its adoption is recommended
here. It adds some more branch types, of which three will be descriped
below: feature, release and hotfix branches.


Feature branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Feature branches hold new features for upcoming releases and are
branched off develop. Feature branches should be prefixed with
"feature/":

.. code-block:: console

   $ git checkout develop
   $ git checkout -b "feature/myfeature"


Once you've added the feature you want, push the branch to bitbucket
and create a pull request to the develop branch.

Release branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Release branches group recent feature changes into a release set. More
code additions can be made, although they should focus on minor fixes.
Documentation updates are encouraged.

When creating a release branch, make sure you branch off develop.
Furthermore, release branches should be prefixed with "release/":

.. code-block:: console

   $ git checkout develop
   $ git checkout -b "release/X.X.X"

Upon creating a release branch, the version number must be bumped,
preferably with `bumpversion`. First check that the changes do what
you expect:

.. code-block:: console

   $ bumpversion --dry-run --verbose --new-version X.X.X part

Note that the part argument should be set to either patch, minor or
major, depending on what part is to be updated. If everything looks
ok, bump the version with

.. code-block:: console

   $ bumpversion --new-version X.X.X part

The configuration is setup not to tag the commit. Since merging is
done on bitbucket, the release tag must be assigned manually to the
master branch, once the release been merged.

When the release branch is finished it is merged into master and
master is backmerged into develop. See the `gitflow cheat sheet`_ for
more information.


Hotfixes
^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally, things break on the master branch that require immediate
fixing. This is what hotfixes are for. Importantly, updates to master
must also be merged immediately with develop to keep it in sync.
gitflow (see following section) has builtin support for hotfixes.

Ideally, *all* hotfixes should be accompanied by a regression test, so
that the error doesn't pop up again.

Using gitflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It may help to use `gitflow`_ to organise work, as it is based on
`Vincent Driessen's branching model`_. The commands simplify the task
of creating feature branches and hotfixes.

To setup gitflow, issue the following in the source code directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git flow init

which produces (press ENTER at each question):

.. code-block:: console

   Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
      - master
   Branch name for production releases: [master]
   Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]

   How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
   Feature branches? [feature/]
   Bugfix branches? [bugfix/]
   Release branches? [release/]
   Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
   Support branches? [support/]
   Version tag prefix? []
   Hooks and filters directory? [/path/to/source/.git/hooks]


Then, to create a feature branch, simply type

.. code-block:: console

   $ git flow feature start test

which produces

.. code-block:: console

   Switched to a new branch 'feature/test'

   Summary of actions:
     - A new branch 'feature/test' was created, based on 'develop'
     - You are now on branch 'feature/test'

   Now, start committing on your feature. When done, use:

       git flow feature finish test

.. warning:: do not issue the finish command locally as it will merge
	     the feature branch into develop. Merging is only done on
	     bitbucket.

Issues
---------

For all problems, small or large, use the issue tracker instead of
sending emails! The main motivation is that all developers should be
able to follow the discussion and history of any issue of general
interest.

Adding a workflow
----------------------

.. note::

   WIP: Describe minimum requirements, including

   1. tests for all sample organizations
   2. example snakefiles and configurations



Continuous integration
-------------------------

As the number of collaborators on a project grows, code integration
problems frequently occur. `Continuous integration`_ is a method for
dealing with these issues. Typically, whenever a push is done to the
repository, tests are automatically run on a test server. bitbucket
has recently added a service called *Pipelines* which gives some
support for CI. It runs integration tests in Docker containers.
:mod:`lts-workflows` provides a Docker container that packages the
basic dependencies for running tests. Each workflow then provides a
separate Docker container that builds on the lts-workflows container,
adding workflow-specific dependencies, for running tests.
