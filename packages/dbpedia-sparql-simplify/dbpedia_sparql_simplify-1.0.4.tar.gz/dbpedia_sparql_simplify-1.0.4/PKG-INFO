Description: =======================
        dbpedia-sparql-simplyfy
        =======================
        
        This library lets you easily create and run SPARQL quieries on dbpedia SPARQL endpoint even if you don't know sparql query language.
        
        ***************
        What is SPARQL
        ***************
        SPARQL is a semantic search query language. It is short for "SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language". You can create and run queries on semantic web using SPARQL query language.
        
        ***********************
        Why use this library?
        ***********************
        In order to retrieve data stored in ``semantic web``, you need to use **SPARQL** queries. You may want to write an application on semantic web or you may just want to examine it. To do both, you need to know SPARQL query language. To learn SPARQL query language, you need to have basic knowledgement on databases. This librarly lets you create SPARQL queries (with some limitations) without knowing SPARQL query language. You can use example.py to do some interesting searches on dbpedia in seconds which would probably take very long on a google search. For example you can do a search like 'Show me the birthdays of partners of partners of Johnny Depp'.
