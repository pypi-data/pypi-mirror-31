Structuralia
============

This suite of python scripts was built to access the PDB database and both prepare inputs and read generated output files.

It relies mainly on Biopython and Biopandas to manipulate PDB structures in convenient ways.

Simply run Access.py to perform some of these functions intuitively.

The Toolbox is packed up with functions that can be imported and used in your own scripts.

Prerequisites

The following packages and external programs are used by Structuralia scripts and must be installed and in either the binaries path or python path.
