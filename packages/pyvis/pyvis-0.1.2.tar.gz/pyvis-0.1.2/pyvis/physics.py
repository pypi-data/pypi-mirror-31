        of some of the equations provided by them and makes use of
        some of the barnesHut implementation in vis. The Main differences
        are the central gravity model, which is here distance independent,
        and repulsion being linear instead of quadratic. Finally, all node
        masses have a multiplier based on the amount of connected edges
