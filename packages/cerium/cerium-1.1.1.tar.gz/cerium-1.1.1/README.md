## [Android Debug Bridge](http://web.mit.edu/ruggles/MacData/afs/sipb/project/android/OldFiles/docs/tools/help/adb.html) 
Cerium requires Android Debug Bridge Tool to with the chosen android device. And Cerium contains *Android Debug Bridge*  by default. You don't need to set the environment variable by yourself.


## Quickstart

* List connected android devices or simulator.
* Show the version of Android Debug Bridge.

```python
from cerium import AndroidDriver

driver = AndroidDriver()

print(driver.devices())
print(driver.devices_l())  # show devices and models

print(driver.version())
```

* Copy local files/directories to device.
* Copy files/directories from device.
* Taking a screenshot of a device display, then copy it to your computer.

```python
from cerium import AndroidDriver

driver = AndroidDriver()

driver.push(local='README.md', remote='/sdcard/README.md')
driver.pull(remote='/sdcard/README.md', local='README.md')

driver.pull_screencap(local='screencap.png')
```

* Simulate finger click.
* Simulate finger slide.
* Input text.

```python
from cerium import AndroidDriver

driver = AndroidDriver()

driver.click(100, 100)
driver.swipe(100, 200, 100, 100, duration=100)
driver.send_keys("I'm White Turing.")
