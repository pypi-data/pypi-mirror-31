    For translated manuals, the command ``doc-tools-check-languages``
    now places a marker file in the root of each directory. This
    marker file is needed for proper publishing in the OpenStack CI
    environment. For details, see
    http://specs.openstack.org/openstack-infra/infra-specs/specs/doc-publishing.html.
