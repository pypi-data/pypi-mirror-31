# revise-x
Use this python package to export models trained with [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras "keras") into a format that can be consumed by [revise](https://github.com/noheltcj/revise "revise")

## Documentation
Currently revise does not support all neural architectures, optimizers, or activation functions.

For a list of supported functions, see the [revise documentation](https://github.com/noheltcj/revise "revise documentation").

## Contributing
We still haven't setup ground rules for contribution. For now, email noheltycolton@gmail.com if you would like to contribute, and we will go from there.

## Setup
Install dependencies for distribution by running: `pipenv install`

### Creating distribution packages
To generate a source distribution, simply run
`pipenv run python setup.py sdist`

To generate a pre-built package with wheel use
`pipenv run python setup.py bdist_wheel`

### Uploading Package to testPyPI
To upload the packages in [dist](./dist) to the test python distribution site, you'll need to create an account at [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/).

Then you can run
`pipenv run twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*`

Enter credentials, and done.
