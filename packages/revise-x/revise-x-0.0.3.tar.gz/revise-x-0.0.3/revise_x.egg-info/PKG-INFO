Description: # revise-x
        Use this python package to export models trained with [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras "keras") into a format that can be consumed by [revise](https://github.com/noheltcj/revise "revise") for use in other platforms.
        
        ## Documentation
        Currently revise does not support all neural architectures, optimizers, or activation functions.
        
        For a list of supported functions, see the [revise documentation](https://github.com/noheltcj/revise "revise documentation").
        
        ### Keras
        ```
        from revise import keras as exporter
        exporter.export()
        ```
