Looks like you haven't had the usual lecture about doing multiprocessing. 
Let me take some time to explain what you just did.

You launched a child process, inside a child process. 
Let that sink in.
What you just did is nothing short of the movie "Inception"

I'm not responsible for what comes after. 
Don't come crying.

Here are the basic rules for multi-processing, as I understand them.

1. Synchronization primitives (locks) are extremely hard to use correctly, so just don't use them at all.
2. The existence of global mutable state indicates a flaw in the applicationâ€™s design, which you should review and change.
3. Don't launch processes inside processes.
4. Don't launch processes inside processes.
5. Don't launch processes inside processes.
...

Hope we all learned something today.

    | These methods are the reason why ZProc is better than traditional multi-processing.
