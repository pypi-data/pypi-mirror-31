pyhbase
^^^^^^^^^^^^

(The development of this package has not finished.)

pybase is a python package used to work HBase.

It is now tested under HBase 1.2.6.

Before using HBase, we are familiar with MongoDB and pymongo.
While, when coming to HBase, we found it is not easy to access the database via python.
So, I spent some days to start this project and hope it can be helpful to our daily research work.
The thought of this package comes from "happybase" and "starbase", and I am trying to make the API behaves like
"pymongo".
