Description: beem - Unofficial Python Library for Steem
        ===============================================
        
        beem is an unofficial python library for steem, which is created new from scratch from `python-bitshares`_
        The library name is derived from a beam maschine, similar to the analogy between steem and steam. beem includes `python-graphenelib`_.

        Support & Documentation
        =======================
        You may find help in the  `beem-discord-channel`_. The discord channel can also be used to discuss things about beem.
        
        A complete library documentation is available at  `beem.readthedocs.io`_.
        
        Installation
        ============
        The minimal working python version is 2.7.x. or 3.4.x
        
        beem can be installed parallel to python-steem.
        
        For Debian and Ubuntu, please ensure that the following packages are installed:
                
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev python-dev
        
        For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, please ensure that the following packages are installed:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo yum install gcc openssl-devel python-devel
        
        For OSX, please do the following::
        
            brew install openssl
            export CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include $CFLAGS"
            export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib $LDFLAGS"
        
        For Termux on Android, please install the following packages:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pkg install clang openssl-dev python-dev
        
        Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install -U cryptography
            
        Install beem by pip::
        
            pip install -U beem
            
        You can install beem from this repository if you want the latest
        but possibly non-compiling version::
        
            git clone https://github.com/holgern/beem.git
            cd beem
            python setup.py build
            
            python setup.py install --user
        
        Run tests after install::
        
            pytest
            
            
        Installing beem with conda-forge
        --------------------------------
        
        Installing beem from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with::
        
            conda config --add channels conda-forge
            
        Once the conda-forge channel has been enabled, beem can be installed with::
        
            conda install beem
        
        Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography::
        
            conda install cryptography
            
        
        CLI tool beempy
        ---------------
        A command line tool is available. The help output shows the available commands:
        
            beempy --help
