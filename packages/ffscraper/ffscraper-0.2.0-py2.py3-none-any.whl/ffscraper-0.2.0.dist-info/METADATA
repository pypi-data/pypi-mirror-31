**Alexander L. Hayes** ([@batflyer](https://github.com/batflyer))

### Installation

`pip install ffscraper`

Requires: `bs4`, `requests`

### Background

FanFiction.Net was established in 1998 and is among the world's largest collection of user-submitted fanfiction (works of fiction authored by fans of existing stories, such as movies, books, or TV shows). The large amount of easily-available user content has drawn interest from those interested in analyzing the content and creative differences between original works and their fanfiction derivatives [1]. More recently, [2] created an anonymized dataset of the metadata from fanfiction sources.

This repository's purpose is twofold: creating robust open-source tools for scraping content, and using that content to build open-source systems which can be used by the FanFiction.Net community.
