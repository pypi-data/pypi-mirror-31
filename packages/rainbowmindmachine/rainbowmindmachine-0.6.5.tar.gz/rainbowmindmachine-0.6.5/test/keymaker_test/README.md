# Keymaker Tests

## Setting Up Tests

Running tests requires `apikeys.py` to be present
in the main repository directory.

The `apikeys.py` file contains your Twitter app's
consumer token and consumer secret.

These tests **will not** publish any tweets.

You can find an example `apikeys.py` file in the 
`rainbowmindmachine` directory (up one)
in `apikeys.example.py`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, just run them with Python:

```
python test_keymaker.py
```

This will attempt to create keys for each item.

### test keymaker

This tests the ability to create one key for each item
passed to the Keymaker by the user.

### test filekeymaker

This tests the ability to read a directory of files of 
arbitrary type and create one key for each text file.

### test txtkeymaker

This tests the ability to read a directory of text files
and create one key for each text file.

### the folders

* ```files/``` - contains dummy files of various types
    for testing FileKeymaker
* ```txt/``` - contains text files for testing TxtKeymaker

### the util

Just prints a little message.
