PHATE - Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHATE has been implemented in Python (2.7 and >=3.5), R and Matlab.

Python installation and dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The Python version of PHATE can be installed using:

   ::

       $ git clone git://github.com/SmitaKrishnaswamy/PHATE.git
       $ cd Python
       $ python setup.py install --user

2. PHATE depends on a number of ``python`` packages available on pypi
   and these dependencies are listed in ``setup.py`` All the
   dependencies will be automatically installed using the above commands

Usage
~~~~~

PHATE has been implemented with an API that should be familiar to those
with experience using scikit-learn. The core of the PHATE package is the
``PHATE`` class which is a subclass of ``sklearn.base.BaseEstimator``.
To get started, ``import phate`` and instantiate a ``phate.PHATE()``
object. Just like most ``sklearn`` estimators, ``PHATE()`` objects have
both ``fit()`` and ``fit_transform()`` methods. For more information,
check out our notebook below.

If you want to try running our test script on a DLA fractal tree: 1.
Make the test scripts executable

::

       $ cd PHATE/Python/test
       $ chmod +x phate_test_tree.py phate_test_mESC.py
       $ ./phate_test_tree.py #output saved in a png
