## Models' Report:

This section contains the analysis of using each model and how well it performs with different parameters. Every model is called from [g07.py](../master/tec/ic/ia/p1/g07.py) and the process is the following:
1. Waiting parameters.
2. Receiving parameters.
3. Creating the respectively model.
3. Generating and normalizing samples (some models differ in normalization methods).
4. Running the model for each round prediction and storing the samples predictions for later.
5. Generating an output file with each sample and its respectively round prediction. The output file is named with a prefix that comes on the parameters.

### Logistic Regression

For logistic regression we had to compare how it performs with regularization L1 and L2. All the experiment combinations were ran 10 times and the value in the table is the mean. Also, all the experiments were ran with normalized samples covering the whole country, the samples were normalized and the labels were transformed to one hot encoding. The algorithm was implemented using Tensorflow and you can follow the process with specific commented functions at [Logistic_Regression.py](../master/tec/ic/ia/p1/models/Logistic_Regression.py). In these tests we used the next hyper-parameters to get the best results:
* Learning rate = 0.01
* Training epochs = 5000
* Batch size = 1000
* Regularization Coefficient = 0.01

The results were:

According to the results for logistic regression using L1 and L2 regularization, we can conclude:

* For Round 1, the L1 regularization gives the minimal error in the prediction at test set. L1 specializes on sparse feature spaces, given the nature of the samples on round 1 (15 classes to predict, and 4 classes with the majority of samples) we can infer L1 performs better because we have the features space on round 1 being more sparse than other rounds. Sparsity on the space means that the dataset have a lot of gaps between different samples and prediction will be harder to get a reasonable accuracy.

* However, looking closely to the table, L2 on Round 1 is very close to L1. But, we can see the L2 regularization doing a little overfitting on training set, which not happens on L1.

* For Round 2 and Round 2 with round 1, we can see accuracy rates very close. The nature of these two groups of samples are the same (4 classes to predict, 2 classes with majority of samples) and with only one difference (Round 2 with round 1 add two attributes: numbers of voters in previous round and vote on previous round). For more details on samples used, go to [Samples Generator](#samples-generator).

* A reason provoking low accuracy rates on this specific model it may be because the space is linearly non-separable, so the error will never be near to zero. Linearly non-separable spaces are the ones that with a linear function you can't separate the classes perfectly. This concept is related with Logistic Regression because the implementation on this model is based on linear models.

### Neural Network

For neural network model we had to compare how it performs with different structures and different activation functions. All the experiment combinations were ran 10 times and the value in the table is the mean. Also, all the experiments were ran with normalized samples covering the whole country, the samples were normalized and the labels were transformed to one hot encoding. The algorithm was implemented using Keras on top of Tensorflow and you can follow the process with specific commented functions at [Neural_Network.py](../master/tec/ic/ia/p1/models/Neural_Network.py). In these tests we used the next hyper-parameters to get the best results:
* Learning rate = 0.01
* Training epochs = 3000
* Batch size = 500

Structures had the input layer's and output layer's amount of units accordingly to the specific prediction round (e.g. the round 1 had 15 units on output layer). We test different hidden layers amount:
* 1 hidden layers with 20 units.
* 2 hidden layers fully connected with 30 and 20 respectively.
* 3 hidden layers fully connected with 30, 20 and 10 respectively.

The activation functions tested were:
* ReLU

### Decision Tree

For the decision tree we had to compare how it performs with different thresholds, different amounts of attributes (r1, r2 and r2 with r1) and other combinations. All the experiment combinations were tested 10 times and the value in the table is the mean of all. The decision tree model was implemented from scratch and you can follow the algorithm with specific commented functions at [Decision_Tree.py](../master/tec/ic/ia/p1/models/Decision_Tree.py).

First we compared the accuracy of the tree without pruning with different thresholds, with the country results. Including the classification r1, r2 and r2 with r1. We make this to see the behavior of the accuracy as it goes down the threshold, comparing the training set with test set.

The threshold is in the range of 0 to 1, where 1 is 100%. It is important to mention that as the node of a tree classifies the data, how closer to 1 is its deviation (value of the chi square), the classification will be worse.

The results were:

According to the results obtained with the threshold change and without pruning, we can conclude that:

* The accuracy of the tree without pruning, with the training set is greater than 99.8%, which indicates that there is an overfitting in the data, the accuracy of the test set is well below 99%. For this reason, an analysis of different values of thresholds for tree pruning is included.

* As the threshold is decreased, the performance of the training set is reduced, while the performance of the test set increases gradually.

* It can be seen that in each estimate vote, if the threshold value is close to 0, the performance of the training set and the test set is reasonably similar.

* With a threshold of 0.02, the performance of the model increases almost ten percent of its original accuracy with the tree without pruning.

* We can observe that the r2 and r2_with_r1 have a similar behavior, the accuracy of the tree without pruning is 53% and with a threshold of 0.02, 62.5%. Including the votes of the first round to estimate the votes of the second round has no direct effect, the classification of the second round that does not take into consideration the first round behaves practically the same.

* Although we can observe that there are two accuracy decreases (r1 with 0.05 and r2_with_r1 with 0.10) as the threshold increases, the highest accuracy results can always be observed at the 0.02 threshold.

Now we see some particular behaviors that have been found in the model. First, we will see the behavior by provinces, specifically Cartago and Puntarenas, to analyze if there are differences in accuracy. Next we will see the behavior of the accuracy when it is trained, but with the restriction that it can not repeat attributes in the whole tree.

In the following table the threshold is 0.02 because it is the one that returns a better accuracy when pruning the tree according to the tables analyzed previously. The result of the tree without pruning is not analyzed.

In the table of provinces we can notice some behaviors different to the estimation behavior by country. The predictions of Cartago surpass the 73% percent accuracy in r2 and r2_with_r1, surpassing by 10% the predictions by country. On the other hand, the opposite effect is seen in Puntarenas, where the accuracy is 55%, being 10% lower than the predictions per country.

In the r1 prediction of Puntarenas, with a threshold of 0.02 the tree is pruned completely, therefore all the outputs are Restauracion Nacional in most of the occasions. We see an accuracy of 35% that obeys the proportion of votes obtained by the aforementioned RN.

It is important to mention what differentiates the provinces to understand the results:

* Cartago was the province that in its two rounds of voting had the lowest proportion of abstinence, while Puntarenas was one of the provinces with the highest proportion of abstinence.  

How does that difference affect? By taking only the people who voted, Cartago is more accurate because there is more data from the entire province, but in Puntarenas you have data from a smaller sector, so the data contains noise when you match the indicators of the entire population of Puntarenas. The indicators used for generating samples, include the population that did not vote, which also affect the model.

The following table also uses the 0.02 threshold because it is the one that returns the best accuracy when pruning the tree according to the tables analyzed previously. The difference of the following prediction to the ones analyzed above, is that the tree was trained with a restriction that will be mentioned later. In this case the accuracy of the unpruned tree is shown, because the results have a different behavior.

We can see that training a tree with a restriction can cause the accuracy to increase considerably, to the point that by applying the 0.02 pruning (when before it was the threshold that caused the highest accuracy) the accuracy can decrease instead of increase.

The restriction is that an attribute can be used only once, not repeatedly as in the previous iterations. With only the training, the performance of the training and testing set is similar, which indicates that there is no overfitting as it exists when the tree is trained allowing repeating attributes.

It can be concluded that, including the restriction, there is no increase in the overall performance of the predictions, but there is a clear decrease in overfitting in their initial training.


### K-Nearest Neighbors

For the Nearest Neighbors with k-d Tree model we had to compare how it performs with different k values, being k the number of nearest neighbors to be analized, and different amounts of attributes (r1, r2 and r2 with r1) (as well as with the other models). All the experiment combinations were tested 10 times and the value that appears in the table is the mean of all. The k-d tree model was implemented from scratch and you can follow the algorithm and read the commented explanations on [K_Nearest_Neighbors.py](../master/tec/ic/ia/p1/models/K_Nearest_Neighbors.py).

First we compared the accuracy of the k-d tree without with different k values, with the country results. Including the classification r1, r2 and r2 with r1. We make this to see the behavior of the accuracy as the k value changes, comparing the training set with test set.

The threshold is in the range of 0 to 1, where 1 is 100%. It is important to mention that as the node of a tree classifies the data, how closer to 1 is its deviation (value of the chi square), the classification will be worse.

The results are:

According to the results obtained with the k value change, we can conclude that:

* The accuracy of the k-d tree increases as the k value does too, which indicates that the model performs better with higher k values and might even work even better with values higher than 7 (it was only possible to test it with 3 different k values due to processing time).

* As the k value increased, the performance of the training set is reduced, while the performance of the test set increases gradually.

* Due to the high amount of dimensions (54 in the case of round 1 or 2, and 56 in the case of round 2 with round 1), the model suffers from the dimensionality so the nearest neighbors are not really near and it affects its accuracy in comparison with the rest of the models.

* Due to the fact that k-d trees are only appropriate when there are many more examples than dimensions, preferably 2^n examples, being n the number of dimensions, we would need to test the model with approximately 17 billion samples to make it perform optimally. If there aren't enough examples, literature states that k-d trees lookup is not faster than linear scan of the whole data set, so the average of processing time of our k-d tree for 10000 samples, calculating the three types of predictions (executing three times) and calculating the error of the whole training set and test set ended up being on average about 2 hours, 15 minutes on an average computer.

* Although the k-d tree tries to be faster by looking for the closest points only in only branch, sometimes it is neccessary to look for them in the other branch (some of the closest points might be in the ignored branch) according to the k-d tree algorithm, and it slows down the processing time a bit more, making the initial advantage disappear.

* Even when the k-d tree is trained with a set of data, and then tested with the same data (training set), it still fails to predict them, that due to the curse of dimensionality. We can state that because the tree succeeds to find the nearest point almost always but it gets confused with the rest of near points, because they are quite far.

* As well as in the case of the Decision Tree, we can observe that the r2 and r2_with_r1 modes have similar behavior, the accuracy values of the k-d tree between the two modes differ in a range of 0.00035-0.0073. Including the votes of the first round to estimate the votes of the second round has no direct effect, the classification of the second round that does not take into consideration the first round behaves practically the same.

As we mentioned before in the Decision Tree section, we observed the behavior by provinces, and found out that the accuracy was notably better in the case of Cartago, not only in comparison to Puntarenas, but also in comparison to the accuracy measured with data from all the country. 

Next, we will see the behavior of the accuracy when it is trained with only data from Cartago. As for k, it will only be configured with the values of 3 and 7, because it was checked above that accuracy increased as k did too, and these two values showed a bigger difference.

According to the results obtained, we can conclude that:

* In the table of Cartago we can notice some behaviors different to the estimation behavior by country. The predictions of Cartago surpass significantly every accuracy value in r2 and r2_with_r1 in the previous experiment with k=3 and k-7. As we mentioned before, Cartago was the province that in its two rounds of voting had the lowest proportion of abstinence.

* This is other example that shows that by taking only the people who voted, Cartago's predictions are more accurate because there is more data from the entire province, and because the indicators used for generating samples includes the whole population of the province, which makes the data connect pretty well.

As an overall conclusion, it can be observed that round 1 predictions have almost always low accuracy. It might be due to some attributes that bring some noise to the data set, or because plenty of factors affected the vote choice for that round and some or them were not included in the sample generator. 

### Support Vector Machine


## Samples Generator
The creation of samples was done by using a Python module developed by our work team called tec.ic.ia.pc1.g07, which contains all the logic necessary to recreate a population of N Costa Ricans and their the vote for the first and second round of the 2018 electoral process. The discribed module tec.ic.ia.pc1.g07 can be found on [pc1](../master/tec/ic/ia/pc1) or can be installed using pip:
```pip install tec.ic.ia.pc1.g07```


This module needs three auxiliary files to produce the samples: [Juntas.csv](../master/Juntas.csv), [VotosxPartidoxJunta.csv](../master/VotosxPartidoxJunta.csv) and [Indicadores_x_Canton.csv](../master/Indicadores_x_Canton.csv), because each of them has important details regarding the population that helps the generator to be as precise as possible and to be faithful to the reality of Costa Rica's population.
These three mentioned files contain data from the scrutiny records of the elections, the maping of the voting boards to their locations, and the location indicators (regarding its population).
First, in Juntas.csv each of its rows represents a voting board, and its columns represent the following data in the same order:

    1.  Province
    2.  Canton
    3.  District
    4.  Neighborhood
    5.  Board Number
    6.  Number of Electors
    7.  Received Votes (First Round)
    8.  Received Votes (Second Round).

In the case of VotosxPartidoxJunta.csv, each row represents the votes from each voting board for each party, and the columns represent the following data in the same order:

    1. Board Number
    2. Accesibilidad sin Exclusi√≥n
    3. Acci√≥n Ciudadana
    4. Alianza Dem√≥crata Cristiana
    5. De Los Trabajadores
    6. Frente Amplio
    7. Integraci√≥n Nacional
    8. Liberaci√≥n Nacional
    9. Movimiento Libertario
    10. Nueva Generaci√≥n
    11. Renovaci√≥n Costarricense
    12. Republicano Social Cristiano
    13. Restauraci√≥n Nacional
    14. Unidad Social Cristiana
    15. Null Votes, Blank Votes
    16. Acci√≥n Ciudadana (Second Round)
    17. Restauraci√≥n Nacional (Second Round)
    18. Null Votes (Second Round)
    19. Blank Votes (Second Round).

Lastly, in Indicadores_x_Canton.csv each row represents a canton in Costa Rica, and each column represents the following data in the same order:

    1. Province
    2. Canton
    3. Total Population
    4. Canton Surface (Km2)

Now, the general operation of the generator is going to be explained by the steps it goes through to create the samples:

* It contains two different functions in case the samples must belong to the country or a single province, so one of the must be called and be told how many samples must be created (and the name of the province if needed).
    * If the samples must belong to the whole country, the function opens the files mentioned above, and for each sample it chooses a random voting board. This is done by taking the number of electors of the voting boards, calculating their ranges, generating a random number and classifying it in a range.
    * If the samples must belong to a single province, the function opens the files mentioned above, calculates the indexes for the province data, and for each sample it chooses a random voting board. This is done by taking the number of electors of the voting boards, calculating their ranges, generating a random number and classifying it in a range.
* For each sample, the generator locates the data from the selected voting board, and that way it gets the demographic and geographic information for it. The general canton information that doesn't need to be calculated is just taken from the files and copied to the sample.
* For each sample, the attributes that must be calculated and randomized are calculated the same way the number of voting board is: taking the values for each attribute from the files, calculating their ranges, generating a random number and classifying it in a range.
* All the samples are returned.

The following list shows all the attributes generated for each sample:

>Note:
>
>It is only considered the possibility of a generated sample to be illiterate if they don't have an education, or they have incomplete primary school studies, because the Costa Rican education system ensures that a person with complete primary school studies cannot be illiterate.
>
>To generate the Average Education For Their Age, the 25-49 years range is taken as if it started at 18 because of lack of data for ages lower than 25 years.
>
>To generate the Assistance Percentage to Regular Education for Their Age, the 5-17 years range is taken as the 15-19 years range, and the 18-24 years range as the 20-24 years range, because of lack of data accuracy between the age ranges for the samples, and the age ranges from the Assistance Percentage to Regular Education Information used.
>
>It is only considered the possibility of a person being outside of the work force because of being retired if their age exceeds 60 years, that due to the Costa Rican legislation in the matter.
