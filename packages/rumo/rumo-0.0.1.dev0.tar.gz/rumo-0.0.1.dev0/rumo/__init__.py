Stream-Based Runtime Monitoring (RUMO)
======================================
RUMO is a stream-based runtime monitoring framework for Python. Formally RUMO is based on
the stream-based specification language Lola [1]. RUMO's solid formal foundation and well
integration into the Python ecosystem makes writing specifications and monitoring them a
breeze. The rich collection of Python third-party libraries allow RUMO to be interfaced
with nearly anything from IOT hardware to cloud-based services.
