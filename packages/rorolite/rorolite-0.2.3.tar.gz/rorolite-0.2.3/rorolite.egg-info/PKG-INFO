        rorolite is a command-line tool to deploy ML applications written in Python to your own server with a single command. It is an open-source tool licensed under Apache license.
        
        The interface of ``rorolite`` is based on the interface of `rorodata platform <http://rorodata.com>`_. While ``rorolite`` is limited to running programs on already created server, the [rorodata platform][rorodata] allows allocating compute resources on demand and provides more tools to streamline data science.
        
        Currently ``rorolite`` is limited to deploying one project per server.
