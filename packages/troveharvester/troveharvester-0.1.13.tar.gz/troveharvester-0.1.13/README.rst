TroveHarvester
==============

This is a tool for harvesting large quantities of digitised newspaper articles from `Trove <http://trove.nla.gov.au>`_.

It has been tested on MacOSX and Windows 7, and should work ok with Python 2.7 and Python 3.

Installation via Docker
-----------------------

Assuming you have Docker installed and running, just spin up a troveharvester container:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -v $(pwd):/troveharvester/data -it wragge/troveharvester /bin/bash

Note that this will store the harvested data in the current working directory on your local filesystem.

Installation via pip
--------------------

Assuming you have Python and `Virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ installed just:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv mytroveharvests
    $ cd mytroveharvests
    $ source bin/activate
    $ pip install troveharvester

On Windows it should be:

.. code-block:: bash

    > virtualenv mytroveharvests
    > cd mytroveharvests
    > Scripts\activate
    > pip install troveharvester

Basic usage
-----------

Before you do any harvesting you need to get yourself a `Trove API key <http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/building-with-trove/api>`_.

There are three basic commands:

* **start** -- start a new harvest
* **restart** -- restart a stalled harvest
* **report** -- view harvest details

Start a harvest
---------------

To start a new harvest you can just do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd mytroveharvests
    $ source bin/activate
    $ troveharvester start "[Trove query]" [Trove API key]

Or on Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    > cd mytroveharvests
    > Scripts\activate
    > troveharvester start "[Trove query]" [Trove API key]

The Trove query can either be a url copy and pasted from a search in the `Trove web interface <http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/>`_, or a Trove API query url constructed using something like the `Trove API Console <https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/>`_. Enclose the url in double quotes.

A  ``data`` directory will be automatically created to hold all of your harvests. Each harvest will be saved into a directory named with a current timestamp. Details of harvested articles are written to a CSV file named ``results.csv``. The harvest configuration details are also saved to a ``metadata.json`` file.

Options:

--max [integer]
    specify a maximum number of articles to harvest (multiples of 20)

\--pdf
    save a copy of each each as a PDF (this makes the harvest a *lot* slower as you have to allow a couple of seconds for each PDF to generate)

\--text
    save the OCRd text of each article into a separate ``.txt`` file

Restart a harvest
-----------------

Things go wrong and harvests get interrupted. If your harvest stops before it should, you can just do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ troveharvester restart

By default the script will try to restart the most recent harvest. You can also restart an earlier harvest:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ troveharvester restart --harvest [harvest timestamp]

Get a summary of a harvest
--------------------------

If you'd like to quickly check the status of a harvest, just try:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ troveharvester report

By default the script will report on the most recent harvest. You can get a summary for an earlier harvest:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ troveharvester report --harvest [harvest timestamp]
