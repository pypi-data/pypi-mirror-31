Description: # inappropriate-notifications
        Ever want to get inappropriate notifications while you're presenting? Well now you can!
        
        Based off of the homepage of https://muzzleapp.com/
        
        Using notifications from https://muzzleapp.com/notifications/notifications.json
        
        Using users from https://randomuser.me
        
        ## Requirements
        ### Linux
        python3.6+
        libnotify
        
        ### Windows
        python3.6+
        win10toast (`pip install win10toast`)
        
        ## Usage
        `git clone https://github.com/riley-martine/inappropriate-notifications.git`
        
        `cd inappropriate-notifications`
        
        `python3.6 setup.py install`
        
        `inappropriate-notifications`
        
        ## Caveats (To fix)
        * Only tested on Ubuntu and Windows
        * Relies on libnotify on Linux
        * Icons are for Mac apps and need to be replaced with the ones you use
        * No fields on notifications (reply, dismiss) where applicable
        * Does not pull names/images from people you know when applicable
        * Only suited to work env -- students don't need messages about getting fired
