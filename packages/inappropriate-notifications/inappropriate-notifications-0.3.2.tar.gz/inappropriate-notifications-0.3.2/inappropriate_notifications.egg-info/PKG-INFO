        ===========================

        you're presenting? Well now you can!
        
        Based off of the homepage of https://muzzleapp.com/. Check out their
        website to see an example of what this does.
        
        This program uses notifications from
        https://muzzleapp.com/notifications/notifications.json, as well as those
        we came up with ourself.
        
        User names and images downloaded from https://randomuser.me.

        Caveats (To fix / to do)
        ------------------------
        
        -  Only tested on Ubuntu and Windows 10 (MacOS and Windows 7 on roadmap)
        -  Relies on libnotify on Linux
        -  Icons are for Mac apps and need to be replaced with the ones you use
        -  No fields on notifications (reply, dismiss) where applicable
        -  Does not pull names/images from people you know when applicable
        -  Only suited to work env -- students don't need messages about getting
           fired
        -  Not a pypi package
        -  No tests
        -  ctrl-c when running command line should fail nicer
        -  Right-to-left names mess up first line
