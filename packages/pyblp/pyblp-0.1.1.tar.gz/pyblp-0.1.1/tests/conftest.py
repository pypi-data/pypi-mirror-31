    The replication code was modified to output one Matlab data file for each dataset (BLP automobile data and Nevo's
    cereal data), each containing the results of one round of Knitro optimization and post-estimation calculations. The
    replication code was kept mostly intact, but was modified slightly in the following ways:

        - Tolerance parameters, Knitro optimization parameters, and starting values for sigma were all configured.
        - A bug in the code's computation of the BLP instruments was fixed. When creating a vector of "other" and
          "rival" sums, the code did not specify a dimension over which to sum, which created problems with one-
          dimensional vectors. A dimension of 1 was added to both sum commands.
        - For the Nevo data, the constant column and the column of prices were swapped in X2. Parameter matrices were
          changed accordingly. For example, before elasticities were computed, the order of coefficients was changed to
          reflect the new position of prices.
        - Delta was initialized as the solution to the Logit model.
        - After estimation, the objective was called again at the optimal parameters to re-load globals at the optimal
          parameter values.
        - Before being saved to a Matlab data file, matrices were renamed and reshaped.
