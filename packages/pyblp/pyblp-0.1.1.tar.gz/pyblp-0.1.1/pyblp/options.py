Attributes
----------
digits : `int`
    Number of digits displayed by status updates. The default number of digits is ``10``. The number of digits can be
    changed to, for example, ``20``, with ``pyblp.options.digits = 20``.

verbose : `bool`
    Whether to output information and status updates. By default, verbosity is turned on. Verbosity can be turned off
    with ``pyblp.options.verbose = False``.

dtype : `dtype`
    The data type used for all numeric calculations, which is by default ``numpy.float64``. The other recommended option
    is ``numpy.longdouble``, which is the only extended precision floating point type that NumPy currently supports. One
    instance in which extended precision can be helpful in the BLP problem is when there are a large number of near zero
    choice probabilities with small integration weights, which, under standard precision are called zeros when in
    aggregate they are nonzero. For example, :ref:`Skrainka (2012) <s12>` finds that using long doubles is sufficient to
    solve many utility floating point problems.

    The precision of ``numpy.longdouble`` depends on the platform on which NumPy is installed. For example, on Windows,
    NumPy is often compiled such that ``numpy.longdouble`` is identical to ``numpy.float64``. Precisions can be compared
    with :class:`numpy.finfo`.

    .. ipython:: python

       np.finfo(np.float64)
       np.finfo(np.longdouble)

    If extended precisions is supported, the data type used by all numeric calculations can be switched with
    ``pyblp.options.dtype = np.longdouble``. For more information, refer to
    `this discussion <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.types.html#extended-precision>`_.
