Description: Mintty Theme Selector
        ===
        
        Python script to change between `mintty` themes from the command line
        
        * [Save your themes][1] &mdash; `~/.mintty/themes`
        * Install the script &mdash; `pip install mintty-theme-selector`
        * List themes &mdash; `mts`
        * Select a theme &mdash; `mts my-theme`
        
        *Important*: `my-theme` is a regex which will be matched against theme filenames without extension, so `mts my-theme$` and similar works.
