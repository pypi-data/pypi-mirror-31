        This library is an extension library build on top of selenium.
        
        It provided a bunch features that need in production enviroment but selenium
        have not provide yet or won't provided by design even in future:
        
        - Added force_xxx() series functions to invoke the element directly even the
          element be covered by other elements. Just as force_click(), force_focus(),
          etc...
        - Added force_get() method to webdriver, it will stop the page loading after
          page loading timeout exception happen, so that the next script could just
          run without break by that exception.
        - Added ability to set element's attribute
        - Provided xpath_find(), xpath_find_all(), etc. For simply invoke xpath for
          recursively find elements. it would iterate each frame and each window to
          find your elements and do the actions without switch frame manually, that
          could reduce a great lot jobs.
        - Provided some advance UI class to wrap for some third-parties editors ( Just
          like TinyMCE )
        
        Usage
        ===============
        
        Simple xpath_find_all() sample:
        
        ::
        
            import time
            import rabird.selenium
            rabird.selenium.monkey_patch()
            from rabird.selenium import webdriver
        
            driver = webdriver.Chrome()
            webdriver.set_recommend_preferences(driver)
        
            driver.force_get("http://www.bing.com")
        
            elements = driver.xpath_find_all("//*[@id='sb_form_q']")
        
            print(elements)
        
            time.sleep(10)
