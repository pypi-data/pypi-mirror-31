Chinese Payroll Rules
=====================

    This module extends the functionality of the standard HR Payroll module 
    and adds complete Chinese payroll rules for the following cities:

    * Shanghai
    * Shenzhen
    * Nangjing

    Are included the following concepts:

    * Personal Social insurance
    * Company contribution
    * Personal Income tax

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

    * Select the corresponding rule to your employee
    * Adjust some percentage in the rule (depending on the company)


Known issues / Roadmap
======================

    * some rules are company dependent and cannot be automated. 
    * They could be added at the company level as a setting instead of having to modify the rules directly
    * add more cities/provinces in the future
