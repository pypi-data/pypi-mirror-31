**Note for MacOS users**: If you experience problems with fork in macOS, put `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` in your environment variable to fix the issue. This is an issue with macOS 10.13 where Apple changed the way fork() works on the OS which is incompatible with Python fork().
 
**Note for Windows users**: Currently the program is not working for windows

* **If you have any problems do open an issue**
