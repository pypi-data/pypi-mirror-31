class Loader:
    """
    A loader object that recursively loads data into
    the desired type.

    basictypes: a set of types that are considered as
        building blocks for everything else and do not
        need to be converted further.
        If you are not loading from json, you probably
        want to add bytes to the set.

    failonextra: When enabled, the loader will raise
        exceptions if there are fields in the data that
        are not being used by the type.

    basiccast: When enabled, instead of trying to perform
        casts, exceptions will be raised.
        Since many json seem to encode numbers as strings,
        to avoid extra complications this functionality is
        provided.
        If you know that your original data is encoded
        properly, it is better to disable this.


    There is support for:
        * Basic python types (int, str, bool, float, NoneType)
        * NamedTuple
        * Enum
        * Optional[SomeType]
        * List[SomeType]
        * Dict[TypeA, TypeB]
        * Tuple[TypeA, TypeB, TypeC]
        * Set[SomeType]
        * Union[TypeA, TypeB]

    Using unions is complicated. If the types in the union are too
    similar to each other, it is easy to obtain an unexpected type.
