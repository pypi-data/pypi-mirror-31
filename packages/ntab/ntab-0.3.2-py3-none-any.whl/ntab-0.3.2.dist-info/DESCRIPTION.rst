A lightweight Python tabular data structure.

Collects parallel numpy arrays into a tabular data structure.  Provides
syntactic sugar for column- and row-wise access, and basic grouping and
aggregation.  Avoids copies and type conversions; does not mess around with the
underlying numpy arrays.  Much less functionality than Pandas, with many fewer
lines of code.
