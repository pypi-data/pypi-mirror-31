        metrics.pytest-cov
        ==================
        
        The **metrics.pytest-cov** package is a plugin for the metrics package.
        
        Basically what this plugin does is it extract the data you get from
        running “$ coverage report -m” on the command line.
        
        We assume that you run your pytest tests (incl. pytest-cov) before your
        run metrics. In case your test execution fails you should fix your code
        and rerun the tests prior to running metrics with this plugin.
        
        The metrics.pytest-cov plugin picks up the .coverage file from your
        successful test run. If you must know, we could run the tests but
        decided not to.
        
        Please note that in case a .coverage file from a testrun is not
        available we silently do nothing.
