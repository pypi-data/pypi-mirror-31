=========
Changelog
=========

1.3.7 (current)
---------------

Released: 2018-05-10

  * replaced CHANGELOG.rst and README.rst by many small rst files and readme
    as well as changelog updated (mostly wrote it new from scratch)

  * docs fixed to fit format needed for manpage

  * removed throw_keys for encryption while gpg library does not support it -.-

  * fixed receiving wrong passphrase in some cases if more than one user has
    matching entrys for the query

  * readded '-l /dev/null' arguments for xsel (unfortunately ~/.xsel.log is
    created anyways) suppressing messages like:
    >XIO:  fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server ":"
    >      after 30 requests (28 known processed) with 0 events remaining.


1.3.6
-----

Released: 2018-05-08

  * deletion of ~/.pwd.yaml is removed permanently

  * changed README again to fit current state

  * added trow_keyids option to the encrypt function trying to fix a bug with
    multiple recipients - if decrypting and having only one of the secret keys
    in the keyring while trying to decrypt it always fails


1.3.5
-----

Released: 2018-05-06

  * fixed bug when merging crypted dictionary resulting in a string where a
    dictionary should be

  * fix bug when adding/changing/deleting entrys will not show result on cli

  * minor update to error messages and small efficiency updates of output

  * fixed nonsense and formatting in README

  * fixed deb package dependencies

  * readded description to __pkginfo__.py (dunno how it lost em)

  * lots of changes to my build environment so files may have moved over
    the last releases


1.3.4
-----

Released: 2018-04-28

  * some more changes to build environment (not really of interest for pwclip)

  * fixed locations in pkginfo to match index/download url, fixed license
    in "intended audience" classifiers and changed some release information

  * some more changes for user dialogs in x mode like possible repitition of
    input as well as some more error messages

  * implemented most commandline options in gui mode as well

  * pwcli -o/--out now uses sys.stdout and pwclip -o/--out uses xvkbd

  * yubikey function was missing selection of correct slot if one is set and
    now it is able to operate on any slot of any yubikey even if more than one
    key is attached

  * some more changes merged from master whith different relationship to pwclip

  * download link now points to pwclip in my debian repo for current version

  * removed depricated dependencies from __pkginfo__ and deb/DEPENDS as i found
    out that they've never been used for packaging :-( i workaround building
    the package by hand for now

  * fixed bug when merging passwords from yaml into passcrypt also the deletion
    of the plain-text password file when finished merging is working again

  * made -p/--password & --comment independent from each other
