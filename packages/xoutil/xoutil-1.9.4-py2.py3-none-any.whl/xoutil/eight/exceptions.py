'''Solve compatibility issues for exceptions handling.

Python 2 defines a module named `exceptions` but Python 3 doesn't.  We decided
not to implement something similar, for example, in `xoutil.future`:mod:
package because all these exception classes are built-ins in both Python major
versions, so use any of them directly; nevertheless `StandardError`:class: is
undefined in Python 3, we introduce some adjustments here in base classes
(`BaseException`:class: and `StandardError`:class: classes).

The functions `catch`:func: and `throw`:func: unify syntax differences raising
exceptions.  In Python 2 the syntax for ``raise`` is::

  "raise" [type ["," value ["," traceback]]]

and in Python 3::

  "raise" [error[.with_traceback(traceback)] ["from" cause]]

You can use `catch`:func: as a function to wrap errors going to be raised with
a homogeneous syntax using a `trace` extra argument::

    >>> divisor = 0
    >>> try:
    ...     inverted = 1/divisor
    ... except Exception:
    ...     raise catch(ValueError('Invalid divisor.'))

If you want to be completely compatible raising exceptions with trace-backs,
use the `throw`:func: function instead the ``raise`` statement.
