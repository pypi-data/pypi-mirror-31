Description: ************************************
        Domain Driven Design - Domain Events
        ************************************
        
        Inspired by `Udi Dahan's fabulous Domain Events <http://udidahan.com/2009/06/14/domain-events-salvation>`_
        implementation in particular, and by `Domain Driven Design <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design>`_
        best practices in general.
        
        The DDD Domain Events package makes it easy to:
            - Register to **Domain Events** from the **Application Layer**
            - Raise **Domain Events** from the **Domain Layer** so they can be handled in the **Application Layer**
        
        The *Domain Events* are local to the execution thread
        (via Python's `threading.local <https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html>`_)
        and hence are thread specific.
        
        
        Installing ddd-domain-events
        ----------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          pip install ddd-domain-events
        
        
        Why should you consider using Domain Events?
        --------------------------------------------
        Domain Events are based on the `Observer Design Pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern>`_, which is a
        convenient way to decouple your *Domain Layer Business Logic* from the *Application Layer* code - especially as the
        Domain code should have no *Infrastructure Layer* dependencies (such as calling Repositories or Providers that call
        external services).
        
        In other words, your *Domain Entities* should have no access to the *Application Layer Services* - and
        hence, your *Entities* might use *Domain Events* to indirectly communicate with *Application Services*.
        
        For example, say you have a Gaming Domain with a User entity that has *add_points(number_of_points)* behavior.
        Whenever *add_points* is executed, the obvious expected behavior is to add the provided number of points to the
        specific user. However, in our sample game, whenever a user reaches 1,000 points then she should receive the "Master"
        badge, and whenever the user reaches 1,000,000 points then she should receive the "Champion" badge.
        
        Your Application Layer pseudo python code might look like this:
        
            .. code-block:: python
        
                user.add_points(10,000)
                if user.has_reached_master_level:
                    # TODO: Send the user a congratulation email...
                elif user.has_reached_champion_level:
                    # TODO: Send the user both a congratulation email and a check...
        
        The above code is perfectly o.k. - yet, as there will be more actions / options that
        are the consequence of *add_points*, then the code will become more and more cumbersome.
        
        Using the Domain Events alternative, will allow you to write code that looks more like this pseudo code:
        
            .. code-block:: python
        
                domain_events.register_event(has_reached_master_level_callback)
                domain_events.register_event(has_reached_champion_level_callback)
        
                user.add_points(10,000)
        
        This code is cleaner and arguably easier to extend, as shown bellow:
        
            .. code-block:: python
        
                domain_events.register_event(has_reached_master_level_callback)
                domain_events.register_event(has_reached_champion_level_callback)
                # introduce new level...
                domain_events.register_event(has_reached_intermediate_level_callback)
        
                user.add_points(50)
        
        Last but not least, Domain Events allow you to keep your Entity's code cleaner - with less methods
        (such as *has_reached_master_level* and *has_reached_champion_level* which can be omitted) that might be
        relatively complex - as they might require you to use additional state in the entity (so that you know if
        the user has reached the current level following the recent call to *add_points*).
        
        
        Using DDD Domain Events
        -----------------------
        
        Using Domain Events in an existing Application Service can easily be achieved by using Python's **with-statement**.
        
        For example:
        
        **Somewhere in the Application Layer...**
        
            .. code-block:: python
        
                with DomainEvents() as domain_events:
                    # create a callback to the notify_top_management Application Layer function
                    high_price_volume_callback = DomainEventCallable(OrderEvent.HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE, notify_top_management),
        
                    # register callback - so it can be triggered from the Domain Layer
                    domain_events.register_event(high_price_volume_callback)
        
                    # create Domain Entity
                    order = Order()
        
                    # execute a Domain method that might raise the relevant Domain Event
                    order.add_order_items(order_items)
        
        
        **Somewhere in the Domain Layer...**
        
            .. code-block:: python
        
                # Domain entity raises a Domain Event - allowing the Application Layer
                # to take a relevant action.
                DomainEvents.raise_event(OrderEvent.HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE, order=self)
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        Bellow is a simplified example that should help you understand how and when you might choose to use **Domain Events**.
        
        
            *Step 1*: Define a **Domain Event Type** in your **Domain Layer**
        
                .. code-block:: python
        
                    from ddd_domain_events import DomainEvents, DomainEventCallable
        
                    class OrderEvent(Enum):
                        """Domain Event raised for special order use cases"""
                        HIGH_QUANTITY = 'HIGH_QUANTITY'
                        HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE = 'HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE'
        
        
            Step 2: Define a **Domain Entity** that raises Domain Events
        
                .. code-block:: python
        
                    class OrderItem:
                        """OrderItem value object that contains order details for a single item"""
                        def __init__(self, product_id: str, price: float, quantity: int):
                            self.product_id = product_id
                            self.price = price
                            self.quantity = quantity
        
                    class Order:
                        """Order entity that contains order items"""
                        HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE = 1_000_000
                        HIGH_QUANTITY = 10_000
        
                        def __init__(self):
                            self._order_items = []
        
                        @property
                        def order_items(self):
                            for order_item in self._order_items:
                                yield order_item
        
                        def add_order_items(self, order_items: List[OrderItem]) -> None:
                            total_price = 0
                            total_quantity = 0
        
                            for order_item in order_items:
                                total_price += (order_item.price * order_item.quantity)
                                total_quantity += order_item.quantity
                                # Process the actual business logic related to this method,
                                # which is add OrderItem value objects to this Order Entity
                                self._order_items.append(order_item)
        
                            # Notify whoever might be interested about high price volume orders
                            if total_price >= self.HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE:
                                DomainEvents.raise_event(OrderEvent.HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE, order=self)
        
                            # Notify whoever might be interested about high quantity volume orders
                            if total_quantity >= self.HIGH_QUANTITY:
                                DomainEvents.raise_event(OrderEvent.HIGH_QUANTITY, order=self)
        
            *Step 3*: Define an **Application Service** that registers to **Domain Events**
        
                .. code-block:: python
        
                    class OrderService:
                        """Application Service for handling Order related operations"""
                        @classmethod
                        def create_order(cls, order_items: List[OrderItem]) -> Order:
                            with DomainEvents() as domain_events:
                                # Create callbacks for 'side effects' that are related to domain logic,
                                # and which should be handled by the Application Layer
                                callbacks = [
                                    DomainEventCallable(OrderEvent.HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE, cls.notify_top_management),
                                    DomainEventCallable(OrderEvent.HIGH_VOLUME_PRICE, cls.notify_sales_team),
                                    DomainEventCallable(OrderEvent.HIGH_QUANTITY, cls.notify_inventory_team)
                                ]
        
                                # Register for these domain events
                                for callback in callbacks:
                                    domain_events.register_event(callback)
        
                                order = Order()
        
                                order.add_order_items(order_items)
        
                                return order
        
                        @staticmethod
                        def notify_sales_team(order: Order) -> None:
                            """A callback for notifying the sales team about the important order"""
        
                        @staticmethod
                        def notify_top_management(order: Order) -> None:
                            """A callback for notifying the top management about the important order"""
        
                        @staticmethod
                        def notify_inventory_team(order: Order) -> None:
