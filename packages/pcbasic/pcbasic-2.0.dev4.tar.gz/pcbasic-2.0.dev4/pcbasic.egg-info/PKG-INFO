Description: PC-BASIC is a free, cross-platform interpreter for GW-BASIC, Advanced BASIC (BASICA), PCjr Cartridge Basic and Tandy 1000 GWBASIC.
        It interprets these BASIC dialects with a high degree of accuracy, aiming for bug-for-bug compatibility.
        PC-BASIC emulates the most common video and audio hardware on which these BASICs used to run.
        PC-BASIC runs plain-text, tokenised and protected .BAS files.
        It implements floating-point arithmetic in the Microsoft Binary Format (MBF) and can therefore
        read and write binary data files created by GW-BASIC.
