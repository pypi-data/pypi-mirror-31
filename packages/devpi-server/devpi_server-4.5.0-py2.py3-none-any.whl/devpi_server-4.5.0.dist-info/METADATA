devpi-server: pypi server for caching and private indexes
=============================================================================

* `issue tracker <https://github.com/devpi/devpi/issues>`_, `repo
  <https://github.com/devpi/devpi>`_

* IRC: #devpi on freenode, `mailing list
  <https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/devpi-dev.python.org/>`_ 

* compatibility: {win,unix}-py{27,34,35,36,py}

consistent robust pypi-cache
============================

You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
index, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted
**and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and
greatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when
offline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.

user specific indexes
=====================

Each user (which can represent a person or a project, team) can have
multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``setup.py``
invocations command.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through a
RESTful HTTP API.

index inheritance
=================

Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
release candidate before you push it to PyPI.

good defaults and easy deployment
=================================

Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. 

separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
==============================================

The complementary `devpi-client <https://pypi.org/project/devpi-client/>`_ tool
helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
installation workflows.

See https://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.

.. towncrier release notes start

4.5.0 (2018-05-04)
==================

Features
--------

- add ``devpiserver_on_remove_file`` hook to handle removal of files in
  plugins. Thanks to Dr Colin Kong for the PR.

- Use ``pypi.org`` as new default for ``root/pypi`` mirror index.


Bug Fixes
---------

- adjust minimum version of pyramid to 1.8 (related to #430)

- fix #494: PEP 503 compliance, html and redirect fixes.

- fix #510: catch another possible error when trying to open sqlite db with uri
  keyword.


4.4.0 (2018-01-17)
==================

Features
--------

- fix issue469: Add ``acl_toxresult_upload`` to index configuration.


Bug Fixes
---------

- fix issue477: importing with --no-root-pypi failed.


4.3.2 (2017-12-19)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- fix issue480: store additional metadata for packages.

- fix issue489: ignore download errors in replica thread for mirrored files
  that were removed from the filesystem on master and from the mirrored source.


4.3.1 (2017-11-23)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- fix +api on replica when master is down.


4.3.1rc1 (2017-09-08)
=====================

Bug Fixes
---------

- fix issue345: remove ``expires -1`` option in example nginx proxy config for
  devpi. When there are no ``Expires`` and ``Cache-Control`` headers, then pip
  does not cache the simple pages, the headers set by ``expires -1`` caused pip
  to cache for 5 minutes.

- fix issue402: the redirect to simple index didn't take X-Outside-Url into
  account.

- fix for url decoding issue with mirrors. When package filenames contain
  characters such as `!` or `+`, these get URL encoded to `%21` and `%2B` in
  the remote simple index. This fix ensures that in the filename saved to the
  disk cache these are decoded back to `!` or `+`.

- fix issue434: ``--status`` didn't work anymore. The background server
  functionality is now deprecated, see --gen-config to use a process manager
  from your OS.

- fix issue449: push to pypi broke again due to a changed reply.

- fix remote file url for mirrors not named "root/pypi" which provide file
  hashes.

- fix issue401: fix traceback and inaccessible index by ignoring removed bases.
