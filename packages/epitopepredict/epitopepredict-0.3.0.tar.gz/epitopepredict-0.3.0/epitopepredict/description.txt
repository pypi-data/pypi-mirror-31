Background
----------

epitopepredict provides a standardized programmatic interface and command line
tool for executing several epitope prediction methods. Currently this largely
consists of interfaces to several MHC binding prediction, the results of which
 can then be processed and visualized in a consistent manner. Many MHC binding
 predictors have been developed but usually not in an open source manner. The
 Tepitope module implements the TEPITOPEPan method is provided as a 'built in'
 method. netMHCIIpan must be downloaded separately from the website and
 installed on your system. The process is quite simple. The same applies for
 the IEDB tools. Both of these tools are free for academic use. It is hoped
 that other epitope predictors will be integrated.
