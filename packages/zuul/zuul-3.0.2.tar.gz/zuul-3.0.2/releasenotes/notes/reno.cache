        This allows jobs to determine the commits that are part of a change, which

        was not possible before. The remote URL is set to a bogus value which

        won''t work with git commands that need to talk to the remote repository.

    fixes: ['Zuul role repository checkouts now honor :attr:`job.override-checkout`.


        Previously, when a Zuul role was specified for a job, Zuul would

        usually checkout the master branch, unless that repository

        appeared in the dependency chain for a patch.  It will now follow

        the usual procedure for determining the branch to check out,

        including honoring :attr:`job.override-checkout` options.


        This may alter the behavior of currently existing jobs.  Depending

        on circumstances, you may need to set

        :attr:`job.override-checkout` or copy roles to other branches of

        projects.
