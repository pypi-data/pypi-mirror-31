        About this project
        ------------------
        
        This project provides the OpenStack Neutron mechanism driver and L2 agent for
        the PR/SM hypervisor of IBM z Systems and IBM LinuxOne machines that are in the
        DPM (Dynamic Partition Manager) administrative mode.
        
        The DPM mode enables dynamic capabilities of the firmware-based PR/SM
        hypervisor that are usually known from software-based hypervisors, such as
        creation, deletion and modification of partitions (i.e. virtual machines) and
        virtual devices within these partitions, and dynamic assignment of these
        virtual devices to physical I/O adapters.
