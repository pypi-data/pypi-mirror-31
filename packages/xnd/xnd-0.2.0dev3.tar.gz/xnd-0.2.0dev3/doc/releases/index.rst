v0.2.0b2 (February 5th 2018)
============================

Second release (beta2). This release addresses several build and packaging issues:

  - Avoid copying libraries into the Python package if system libraries are used.

  - The build and install partially relied on the dev setup (ndtypes checked out
    in the xnd directory).  This dependency has been removed.

  - The conda build now supports separate library and Python module installs.

  - Configure now has a **â€“without-docs** option for skipping the doc install.


v0.2.0b1 (January 20th 2018)
============================

First release (beta1).
