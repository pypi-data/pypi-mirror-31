        ========
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        [idly](http://idly.readthedocs.io) is a collection of popular machine learning algorithms implemented via DNN framework
        
        Goals:
        
        1. Port most common Stat/ML models using DNN frameworks
        2. Import/Export models from/to a variety of DNN frameworks
        3. Drive interpretibility of the models
        
        
        What's in a name - you ask?
        
        Can we have idly along with nice kapy/Java/Mocha and take that question at a nearby Caffe. If you don't know, idly is a popular south Indian steamed rice pancake that tastes just right with a cup of filter coffee.
        
        If you are still wondering - idly stands for **I**nterpretable **D**eep **L**earning. **Y**ay!
        
        Install:
        ```sh
        $ pip install idly
        ```
