        Caution
        -------
        
        This is an alpha release.  While the functionality is sound, the
        packaging is probably not even beta quality.  Compilation of the
        components written in C has only been tested under Linux.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        postconfirm consists of postconfirmd, which is the long-running
        (daemon) part, and postconfirmc, which is the client part of a
        client-server program which handles email confirmations. It is
        intended as a front-end to mailing lists. It provides
        funcitonality which is a subset of TMDA, but is adapted to
        high-volume usage and does not have anywhere near all the bells
        and whistles which TMDA has. On the other hand, since the
        whitelist lookup is done by the long-running server part, the
        overhead of doing a verification that a poster has a confirmed
        address is much smaller than for TMDA.  This makes it a factor
        1000 or more faster than TMDA in production, with a memory footprint
        a factor 20 smaller.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 0.41.5 (20 Apr 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed dmarc_reverse() to not re-send to other addresses than the 
            indicated recipient.
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.41.4 (01 Mar 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed a bug in dmarc_rewrite(), where the return values from
            email.utils.getaddresses() was not handled properly.
        
          * Tweaked some setup error messages
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.41.3 (21 Feb 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added warnings on failure for some post-install actions.
        
          * Changed the interface to accept multiple recipients when given on the
            command line (for use with dmarc-rewrite).  Changed dmarc-rewrite to
            accept multiple recipients, and renamed the recipient argument for other
            functions that can accept recipient lists.  
        
          * Changed the -e argument to log arguments to syslog and not exit.
        
          * Reverted an earlier change of socket ownership handling.
