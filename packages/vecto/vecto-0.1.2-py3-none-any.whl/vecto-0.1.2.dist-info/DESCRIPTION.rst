* creating word embeddings by counting and neural-based methods, including sub-word-level models
* importing and exporting from a banch of popular formats of word embeddings and providing unified access to word-vectors
* perfroming a range of downstream tasks / benchmarks on embeddings
* visualising embeddings

How do I get set up?
====================

* ``pip3 install vecto`` for stable version
* ``pip3 install git+https://github.com/vecto-ai/vecto.git`` for latest dev version
