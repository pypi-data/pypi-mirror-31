Description: pycomposer is Python library for Algorithmic Composition or Automatic Composition by Reinforcement Learning such as Q-Learning and Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RTRBM). Q-Learning and RTRBM in this library allows you to extract the melody information about a MIDI tracks and these models can learn and inference patterns of the melody. And This library has wrapper class for converting melody data inferenced by Q-Learning and RTRBM into MIDI file.
