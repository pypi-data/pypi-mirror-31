        =========
        
        Validating JWT tokens from the Google Identity-Aware Proxy as
        middleware.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ::
        
            pip install -e git+git@github.com:newsdev/nyt-pyiap.git
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Django
        ~~~~~~
        
        Add to settings
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Update your ``settings.py`` file to add the Django middleware.
        
        ::
        
            MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
              ...
              'pyiap.django.VerifyJWTMiddleware',
              ...
            ]
        
        The ``request`` object in ``views.py`` will have two new attributes
        added:
        - ``request.jwt_user_id``: The Google internal ID of the user who
        has been verified by IAP.
        - ``request.jwt_user_email``: The email
        address and email type of the user who has been verified by IAP.
        
        Flask
        ~~~~~
        
        Update your Flask ``app.py`` to wrap your instantiated ``Flask()``
        application's ``wsgi_app`` with the ``VerifyJWTMiddleware``.
        
        ::
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
            app.wsgi_app = VerifyJWTMiddleware(app.wsgi_app)
        
        The ``request.environ`` object in ``app.py`` will have two new
        attributes added:
        - ``request.environ['jwt_user_id']``: The Google
        internal ID of the user who has been verified by IAP.
        - ``request.environ['jwt_user_email']``: The email address and email type
        of the user who has been verified by IAP.
