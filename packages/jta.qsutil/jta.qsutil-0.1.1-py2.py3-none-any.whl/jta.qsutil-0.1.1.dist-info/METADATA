The specifications that define the makeup of URLs are
very flexible when it comes to what makes up the query string portion (the part
after the `?`). Many web services have taken the initial recommendation of using
`key=value` pairs to another level by allowing complex structures to be
represented for a sacrifice in parsing performance.

The goals of this project are:
* Be able to process sequence and sub-mapping hints in URL query string keys.
* Only shape values into sequences if there are multiple occurrences of the same
 key or the key contains a sequence hint.
* Remain standards-compliant with URI and URL RFC specs.
* Provide an API similar to Python 3's standard urllib.
* Be Python 2 and 3 compatible without relying on a compatibility library.
