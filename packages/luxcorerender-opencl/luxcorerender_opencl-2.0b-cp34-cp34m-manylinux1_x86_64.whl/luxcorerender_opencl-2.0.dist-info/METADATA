### LuxCoreRender

LuxCoreRender is a physically correct, unbiased rendering engine. It is built on
physically based equations that model the transportation of light. This allows
it to accurately capture a wide range of phenomena which most other rendering
programs are simply unable to reproduce.

You can find more information about at https://www.luxcorerender.org

### LuxCore library

LuxCore is the new LuxCoreRender v2.x C++ and Python API. It is released under Apache Public
License v2.0 and can be freely used in open source and commercial applications.

You can find more information about the API at https://wiki.luxcorerender.org/LuxCore_API

### SLG library

SLG is an implementation of LuxCore API and it can be safely ignored if you are
not interested in internal LuxCoreRender development.

### LuxRays library

LuxRays is the part of LuxCoreRender dedicated to accelerate the ray intersection
process by using CPUs or GPUs.

If you don't have any specific interest in the ray/triangle intersection topic
or internal LuxCoreRender development, you can safely ignore this library.

### LuxCoreUI

This is the most complete example of LuxCore API usage and it is available in
the samples/luxcoreui directory.

To check how it works, just run luxcoreui from the root directory:

`./bin/luxcoreui scenes/cornell/cornell.cfg`

### LuxCoreConsole

This is a simple example of a command line renderer written using LuxCore API and it is
available in the samples/luxcoreconsole directory.
Just run luxcoreconsole from the root directory with:

`./bin/luxcoreconsole -D batch.halttime 10 scenes/cornell/cornell.cfg`

### LuxCore API SDK

If you have downloaded the LuxCore API SDK, to compile the examples use:

```
cmake .
make
```

if you have downloaded the SDK without OpenCL support:

```
cmake -DLUXRAYS_DISABLE_OPENCL=1 .
make
```

### PyLuxCoreTools

PyLuxCoreTools are a set of command line tools available in the LuxCoreRender stand
alone version. The includes network rendering, film merging, command line rendering
and more.

NOTE: pyluxcoretool is a stand-alone, self-containing executable on Windows. On
Linux instead, you have to install Python and PySide before to run the tools. PySide
can be usually installed with a:

sudo pip3 install PySide
(or sudo pip install PySide)

You can avoid to install PySide if you use only the command line tools available in
pyluxcoretool. You can than run pyluxcoretool with a:

python3 pyluxcoretools.zip
(or python pyluxcoretools.zip)
