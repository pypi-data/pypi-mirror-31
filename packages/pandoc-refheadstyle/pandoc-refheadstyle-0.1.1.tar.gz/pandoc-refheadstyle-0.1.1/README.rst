pandoc-refheadstyle
===================

``pandoc-refheadstyle`` sets a custom style for the reference section header,
but only if the metadata field ``reference-section-title`` has been set to a
non-empty value.

By default, the reference section header will be assigned the custom style
'Bibliography Heading'. But you can change what style is assigned by setting
the metadata field ``reference-header-style`` to the name of a style of
your choice. If the style does not exist, it will be created.

See the `manual page <man/pandoc-refheadstyle.rst>`_ for more details.
