Version 1.1.0:

New data: labmathversion

New function: liouville
New function: egypt_short
New function: egypt_greedy
New function: randomfactored
New function: secm
New function: ecmparams

Altered behavior: randprime's output is now uniformly sampled among all primes of the indicated size, and the primality test used is user-selectable.  Full backwards compatibility is preserved.
Altered behavior: ecm is now a shell function that calls secm repeatedly (which is where the factoring now happens) using parameters pulled from ecmparams.  Backwards compatibility is preserved in the positional arguments; backwards compatibility is broken for the keyword arguments.

Improved credits and a few docstrings.
Fixed a bug in which product was not imported from itertools.

Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.7: fumbling around with PyPI.
