KEP.py
=======

A Python parser of Kepware projects.


# Overview


KEP.py parses the .json files exportable from the KEPServerEX
Configuration client.

To use, read the contents of the .json file into a dictionary. Then,
create a `Project` object and pass it the dictionary.

>From that project object, you can now get all of the channels of the
project and so on. The full list of the hierarchy you can reach is as
follows:

```
Channel
└─Device 
  ├─Register (See simulator device)
  └─Tag Group(s)
    ├─tag1
    ├─tag2
    ...
```
