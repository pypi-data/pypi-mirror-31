This is a very simple P2P framework for implement peer-to-peer system into Applications in Python.   
  
## Notice  
Right now this framework does not support any NAT hole paunching.  
Also, only support a very basic P2P communication protocol, you need to wrote your route rule by yourself.  
  
## Feature

  1. Easy implementation of protocols.  
  2. Support TCP server.  
  
## Installation & Useage

```
>>> from MaybeP2P.peer import Peer
>>> p = Peer()
>>> p.start()
...
>>> p.exit()
```
