        This is a very simple P2P framework for implement peer-to-peer system into Applications in Python.   
          
        ## Notice  
        Right now this framework does not support any NAT hole paunching.  
        Also, only support a very basic P2P communication protocol, you need to wrote your route rule by yourself.  
          
        ## Feature
        
          1. Easy implementation of protocols.  
          2. Support TCP server.  
          
        ## Installation & Useage
        `pip install MaybeP2P`
        
        ```
        >>> from MaybeP2P.peer import Peer
        >>> p = Peer()
        >>> p.start()
        ...
        >>> p.exit()
        ```
