    """ Returns a KalmanFilter using newtonian kinematics for an arbitrary

    filter in 3D space would be created with

    kinematic_kf(3, 1)


    which will set the state `x` to be interpreted as

    [x, x', y, y', z, z'].T

    If you set `order_by_dim` to False, then `x` is assumed to be

    [x y z x' y' z'].T

    As another example, a 2D constant jerk is created with

    kinematic_kf(2, 3)


    Assumes that the measurement z is position in each dimension. If this is not
    true you will have to alter the H matrix by hand.

    P, Q, R are all set to the Identity matrix.

    H is assigned assuming the measurement is position, one per dimension `dim`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    dim : int
        number of dimensions

    order : int, >= 1
        order of the filter. 2 would be a const acceleration model.

    dim_z : int, default 1
        size of z vector *per* dimension `dim`. Normally should be 1

    dt : float, default 1.0
        Time step. Used to create the state transition matrix
