# This leaves the error condition where ClientA makes a request, but never retrieves its response.
# When ClientB makes the same request an hour later, the ClientA response is still in the queue.
#
# RESPONSE_VALID_DURATION sets how long ago the response may have been received by the matcher.
# Example:
#   t=0   -> request made, and sent to controller
#   t=100 -> response received from controller, stored in queue
#   t=110 -> response retrieved from queue
#
# In this scenario, the response will only be t=10 old, as it was stored at t=100
