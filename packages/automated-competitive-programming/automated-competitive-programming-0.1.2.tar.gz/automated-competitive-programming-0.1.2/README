# Automated Competitive Programming
Script for fetching and checking problems from various online judges. Currently supports only:

- Online Judges:
    - Codeforces

- Programming Languages:
    - C++

## Motivation
I have searched a lot for this kind of fetcher/checker program for competitive programming only to find the lack of a good/all-in-one solution. This project is an attempt to make one.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The script is written in Python 3.6. It uses Beautiful Soup for web scraping. For installing Beautiful Soup, see [this](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup).

### Installing
Just clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/UnlimitedUser/automated-competitive-programming.git```

## TODO
See [TODO](TODO). The ones marked with '(?)' are under consideration.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
