        ======
        
        An efficient reference implementation of the box least squares algorithm for
        transiting exoplanet search in Python.
        This will eventually be submitted as a pull request to the core AstroPy package, but
        we're making it available here for now to make it easy to use right away.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        To install and run this package, you will need to have NumPy, Cython, and AstroPy installed.
        The recommended installation method is:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
         
            conda install numpy cython astropy
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install, clone this repository and build the extension as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
            
            git clone https://github.com/dfm/bls.py.git
            cd bls.py
            python setup.py install
            
        or, install using ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install bls.py
            
        **OpenMP support**: This algorithm can optionally be parallelized using OpenMP.
        To enable this feature, you must compile with a compiler that supports OpenMP and the
        relevant flags. On macOS, this can be achieved by installing a recent ``llvm``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            brew install llvm
         
        and then building using the following flags:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang \
             LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -liomp5" \
             CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include -fopenmp" \
             python setup.py install
            
        On other platforms, a command like the following might be sufficient:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            CFLAGS="-lgomp -fopenmp" python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See ``tutorial.ipynb`` for a demonstration of how to use the code.
