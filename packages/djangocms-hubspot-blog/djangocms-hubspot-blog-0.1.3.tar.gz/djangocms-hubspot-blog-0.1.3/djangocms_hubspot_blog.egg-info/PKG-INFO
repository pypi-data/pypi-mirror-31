        ==================================
        djangoCMS Hubspot Blog Integration
        ==================================
        
        - Management command to fetch Authors, Topics and Posts and store them in the database    
        - djangoCMS App to hook list and detail view into a page
        
        Usage
        ==================================
        
        - ``pip install djangocms-hubspot-blog``     
        - Add the app ``hubspot_blog`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``    
        - Optionally override the two templates ``hubspot_blog/[post_list.html,post_detail.html]``    
        
        How to fetch blog posts
        -----------------------
        **Automatically**
        
        The best aproach is to **automatically** fetch posts, authors and topics by
        periodically running the management command ``import_blogposts`` via CRON
        or calling ``hubspot_api.update_blog_posts()`` from a task queue.
        
        **Manually**
        
        However, it's also possible for site editors to **manually** trigger an
        update via an admin action (it's needed to select a blog post in order
        to run the action, so for the first time use, run the management command or create a dummy blog post via the admin)
        
        Missing Functionality
        -------------------------
        - Author page    
        - Topic page
