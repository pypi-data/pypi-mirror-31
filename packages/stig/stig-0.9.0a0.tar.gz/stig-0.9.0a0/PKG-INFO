        stig is a TUI (text user interface) and CLI (command line interface)
        client for the `BitTorrent client
        Transmission <http://www.transmissionbt.com/>`__.
        
        stig being in alpha status does **not** mean you should expect bugs.
        It's supposed to indicate that behaviour may change with a new release
        since I'm still experimenting with what works best. If you know how to
        make stig more flexible, convenient, intuitive or just *better*, feel
        free to open an issue.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  **Filters** are used to list/start/stop/remove/etc torrents matching
           any combination of criteria
        -  **Tabs** with list of torrents/peers/files, documentation, etc
        -  **Commands** or **sub-commands** (think git) do everything, and they
           can be invoked
        
           -  through single- or multi-key (think emacs) **keybindings**,
           -  by entering them in a **command prompt** (think vi),
           -  by providing them as **CLI arguments** in your interactive shell
              or in **scripts**,
           -  or by listing them in an **rc file**.
        
        -  **Color themes** support 16 and 256 colors
        -  **Complete built-in documentation** with ``help`` command or
           ``--help`` argument
        -  Full **API abstraction layer** makes it possible to add support for
           other BitTorrent clients with RPC interfaces (contributors are
           welcome)
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Add two torrents, one by file and one by hash, and exit
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig add /path/to/some.torrent d4d6b73851fe3288e40389a8e1fb98124a9b9ba5
        
        Connect to non-default host and present the TUI
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig set connect.host torrents.local
        
        Print all uploading and/or downloading torrents on localhost:9092 and
        exit
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig set connect.port 9092 \; ls active
        
        List torrents with more than 50 seeds, then remove them
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig ls 'seeds>50'
            $ stig rm 'seeds>50'
        
        Stop down/uploading torrents with ``/foo/`` in their download path and a
        ratio above 10
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig stop 'path~/foo/&ratio>10'
        
        Open two tabs with different torrent lists:
        
        -  slowly uploading torrents with ``/foo/`` in their download path
        -  small or well-seeded torrents, sorted by size (ascending) and number
           of seeds (descending)
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig tab ls 'path~/foo/&rate-up<10k' \; tab ls 'size<500M|seeds>=1k' --sort 'size,!seeds'
        
        Configuration and Scripting
        ---------------------------
        
        All configuration is done in an rc file, which is just a script
        containing a list of commands (think vim and .vimrc) that are executed
        during startup. The default rc file is ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/stig/rc``.
        ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` defaults to \`/.config\` if not set.
        
        See ``stig help rcfile`` for more information.
        
        Example rc file
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            # Host that runs Transmission daemon
            set connect.host example.org
            set connect.port 123
        
            # Update torrent/peer/file/etc lists every 10 seconds
            set tui.poll 10
        
            # Default columns in torrent lists
            set columns.torrents name ratio rate-up rate-down
        
            # Open a few tabs on startup
            tab ls active --sort !%downloaded,path,!rate
            tab ls paused --sort !%downloaded --columns name,%downloaded,ratio,size
            tab ls isolated --sort tracker --columns name,path
        
        Run different rc files either with ``stig -c path/to/file`` or with the
        ``rc`` command. You can even turn them into executables with the shebang
        ``#!/path/to/stig -Tc`` (``-T`` disables the TUI, ``-c`` specifies the
        rc file).
        
        Example maintenance script
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            #!/path/to/stig -Tc
            rm path=/path/to/torrents/trash
            pause seeds>100
            start seeds<20&size>10G|seeds<50&size>20G
