AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT) GUI
==================================

AIT GUI provides a framework for building a custom website for realtime
telemetry monitoring, commanding, and other MOS operations with only
minimal HTML and configuration file changes. Built on top of the AIT
Core libraries, AIT GUI provides web-development friendly access to the
underlying telemetry, commanding, EVR, system logging, and other AIT
Core functions in addition to a suite of pre-built UI Components and a
REST API to handle common MOS use cases.
