Installation
------------

``pip install fortran-language-server``

Configuration
-------------

Project specific settings can be specified by placing a JSON file named ``.fortls`` (example below)
in the ``root_dir`` directory.

**Setup module search paths:**

By default all files with the suffix ``F,F77,F90,F95,F03,F08,FOR,FPP`` (case-insensitive) in the
``root_dir`` directory, specified during initialization, and all its sub-directories are parsed and included in
the project.

Directories and files can be excluded from the project by specifying their paths (relative to ``root_dir``) in
the ``excl_paths`` variable in the ``.fortls`` file. Excluded directories also exclude all sub-directories.

Module directories can also be specified manually by specifying their paths (relative to ``root_dir``) in
the ``mod_dirs`` variable in the ``.fortls`` file. When ``mod_dirs`` is specified directories are not added
recursively, so any nested sub directories must be explicitly listed. However, ``root_dir`` does not need to
be specified manually as it is always included.


::

    {
      "mod_dirs": ["subdir1", "subdir2"],
      "excl_paths": ["subdir3", "subdir1/file_to_skip.F90"]
    }
