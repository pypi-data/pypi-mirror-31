        When loading data from multiple files it can be non-trivial to combine
        things like start_time, end_time, start_orbit, end_orbit, etc.

        By default this method will produce a dictionary containing all values
        that were equal across **all** provided info dictionaries.

        Additionally it performs the logical comparisons to produce the
        following if they exist:

         - start_time
         - end_time
         - start_orbit
         - end_orbit
