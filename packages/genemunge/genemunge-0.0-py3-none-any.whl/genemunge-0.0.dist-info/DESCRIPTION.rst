genemunge
=========

Tools for munging genomic data such as: - Converting between different
types of gene identifiers - Searching for terms in the Gene Ontology
(GO) associated with a keyword - Looking up housekeeping genes and
transcription factors - Getting a list of GO terms associated with a
given gene - Looking up how a gene is expressed across tissues -
Normalizing a matrix of gene expression data by converting to TPM

Unlearn.AI
----------

When weâ€™re not developing super awesome open source packages like
``genemunge``, we help biopharma partners use unsupervised deep learning
to extract insights from their omics data. Learn more at
`unlearn.health <http://unlearn.health?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=genemunge>`__.

Install
-------

This library is accompanied by the following data sources: - The `Gene
Ontology <http://geneontology.org/>`__. The current version used here is
the 2018-03-27 release. -
`recount2 <https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/>`__ data for
GTEx. - `HGNC <https://www.genenames.org/>`__ gene symbols. - A list of
`transcription factors <http://www.tfcheckpoint.org/>`__. - A list of
`housekeeping genes <https://www.tau.ac.il/~elieis/HKG/>`__.

Installing this package through ``pip`` (``pip install genemunge`` from PyPI,
``pip install .`` from GitHub) will use the static data that accompanies this repository.

If you wish to use the latest data from the above sources, you may
install in "develop" mode from GitHub with ``pip -e install .``. Notably, this will
download and process the recount2 GTEx data, requiring ``R`` and the
``recount`` package from ``bioconductor``:
