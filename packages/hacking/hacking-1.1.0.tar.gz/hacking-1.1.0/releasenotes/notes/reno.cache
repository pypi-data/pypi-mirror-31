      \ of pep8). Remove the explicit dependencies of\n    hacking as flake8 is going\

      \ needed.\n\n- Allow 'wraps' to be an alternative to autospec:\n\n  * Don't\
      \ cause an H210 error if the mock.patch/mock.patch.object call uses\n    the\
      \ 'wraps' keyword. As that serves the same purpose in catching wrong\n    attributes.\n"}
