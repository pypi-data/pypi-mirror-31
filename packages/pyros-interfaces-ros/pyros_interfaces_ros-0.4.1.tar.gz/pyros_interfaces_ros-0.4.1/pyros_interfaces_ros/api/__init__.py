# CORE ROS API
# This is useful to quickly patch ROS problems

# Note : pyros_setup shouldn't be used here, since we need it for other packages installed in ROS environment,
# and not only for ROS interface. For example many python packages should come from the ROS distro,
# and not from the python system environment.
