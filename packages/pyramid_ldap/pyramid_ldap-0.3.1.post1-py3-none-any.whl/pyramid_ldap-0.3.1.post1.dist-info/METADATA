Pyramid LDAP
############

``pyramid_ldap`` provides LDAP authentication services for your Pyramid
application.  Thanks to the ever-awesome `SurveyMonkey
<http://surveymonkey.com>`_ for sponsoring the development of this package!

See the documentation at
https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_ldap/en/latest/ for more
information.

This package will only work with Pyramid 1.3 and later.

Installation
------------

``pyramid_ldap`` uses ``pyldap`` which in turn requires ``libldap2`` and
``libsasl2`` development headers installed.

On Ubuntu 16.04 you can install them using the command ``apt-get install libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev``.



0.3.1.post1 (2018-05-15)
------------------------

- version changed in setup.py

0.3.1 (2018-05-15)
------------------

- Added wheels license to setup.cfg

0.3 (2018-05-15)
----------------

- Python 3 is now supported! This is possible thanks to python-ldap supporting
  python 3

- BREAKING CHANGE: pyramid_ldap now depends on python-ldap >= 3.0, which
  supports python 2 and 3. If you upgrade pyramid_ldap without upgrading
  python-ldap, you will see failures where python-ldap receives text arguments
  instead of bytes. See below for more information.

- python-ldap >= 3.0 stopped accepting ``bytes`` type arguments for many
  ``LDAPObject`` methods. We now use the ``pyramid.compat.text_`` function to
  support text arguments for python 2 and 3.

- In versions 0.2 and lower, invalid LDAP strings passed to
  ``pyramid_ldap.Connector.authenticate`` would raise ``ldap.FILTER_ERROR``. In
  0.3 and up we use ``ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars`` to properly escape these
  prior to running the LDAP search. Applications using pyramid_ldap have always
  been responsible for making sure the ``login`` value fits the
  ``ldap.login_filter_tpl`` setting in their application. However, if you relied
  on ``ldap.FILTER_ERROR`` to catch bad username formats (such as
  ``CORP\username``, where the unescaped ``\`` is disallowed in LDAP searches),
  note that now ``authenticate`` will return ``None`` instead.

- Use tox for testing against Python 2.7, 3.6, PEP8, coverage and building
  docs. Setup Travis CI to run tox. Use pylons-sphinx-themes to fix broken
  Read The Docs builds.
