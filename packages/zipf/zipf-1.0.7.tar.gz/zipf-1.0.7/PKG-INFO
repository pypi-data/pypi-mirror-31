Description: zipf
        ====
        
        The zipf package was realized to simplify creations and operations with zipf distributions, like:
        
        * Sum/subtract two zipfs.
        * Multiply/divide a zipfs by a zipf or a number.
        * Slice a zipf.
        * KL divergence (entropy) of two zipfs.
        * JS divergence of two zipfs.
        * Statistical operations such as:
            - mean
            - variance
            - median
        
        Currently exists factories to create a zipf from:
        
        * A list.
        * A text.
        * A text file.
        * An url to a webpage.
        * A directory containing one or more directories containing text files.
        
        It is also possible to calculate in batch operations like the `Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence>`_.
