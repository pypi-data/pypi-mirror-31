Tutorial: Converting a project to use Lab Test
==============================================

We are going to convert a Vue.js component for use with LabTest. This tutorial assumes that the test environment or laboratory is already set up, and you have :ref:`set up your local machine <setting_up_your_local_machine>`.


Containerizing
==============

This process involves creating a ``Dockerfile`` and a ``.dockerignore`` file. These files are used in the generation of the container image.

Dockerfile
----------

This file contains the instructions to build the environment we need to run our project. For this project, we simply need to deliver static files generated during the build process.

The build process puts the JavaScript and CSS files in ``dist/``\ . It also puts in an ``index.html`` for demonstration and testing purposes.

The documentation is in the ``docs/`` directory. Typically that is distributed as GitHub pages, but we are going to add it as a subdirectory so we can see any changes to it as well.

Our ``Dockerfile`` ends up being very simple. We use official nginx Docker image running Alpine Linux as a base. The official nginx Docker image serves files in ``/usr/share/nginx/html/`` by default. We then simply need to copy the files into that directory.

.. code-block:: docker
    :caption: ``Dockerfile``

    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY dist/* /usr/share/nginx/html/
    COPY docs /usr/share/nginx/html/docs

.dockerignore
-------------

When Docker builds the image, it generates a context of all the files it may need in your project directory. Since we don't need most of the files, this just takes time and memory.

We add a ``.dockerignore`` file to tell it to ignore most directories.

.. code-block:: none
    :caption: ``.dockerignore``

    build
    config
    node_modules
    src
    static
    test


Building the image
------------------

We can now test build the image with ``docker build -t vizwiz .``

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Building the Docker image

    $ docker build -t vizwiz .
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  9.862MB
    Step 1/3 : FROM nginx:alpine
    alpine: Pulling from library/nginx
    Digest: sha256:3a44395131c5a9704417d19ab4c8d6cb104013659f5babb2f1c632e789588196
    Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:alpine
     ---> ebe2c7c61055
    Step 2/3 : COPY dist/* /usr/share/nginx/html/
     ---> 9e7809fa48f3
    Step 3/3 : COPY docs /usr/share/nginx/html/docs
     ---> 19f6f03422e0
    Successfully built 19f6f03422e0
    Successfully tagged vizwiz:latest

Does it work as we expect? Let's find out! We can run this image with ``docker run --rm -ti -p 8000:80 vizwiz``\ . When you go to ``https://localhost:8000/``\ , you will see traffic in your console:

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Running the new Docker image

    $ docker run --rm -ti -p 8000:80 vizwiz

Press :kbd:`control-c` to stop the running Docker image.

Configuring Lab Test
====================

Lab Test looks for its configuration automatically in several places: ``.labtest.yml`` or ``.labtest.yaml``\ , ``setup.cfg``\ , or ``package.json``\ . We simply add a ``labtest`` section and put in the configuration items.

Since we already have a ``package.json`` file, we will add our Lab Test configuration to it.

.. code-block:: javascript
    :caption: Part of VizWiz's ``package.json`` file

    {
      "name": "vizwiz",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A data visualization widget library",
      // other stuff here
      "labtest": {
        "app_name": "vizwiz",
        "host": "test",
        "use_ssh_config": true,
        "test_domain": "digital-test.boston.gov",
        "code_repo_url": "git@github.com:CityOfBoston/vizwiz.git"
      }
    }

We absolutely have to values for ``host`` and ``test_domain`` because Lab Test has no way to derive a default value for them.

Building the components
=======================

We know that Lab Test can build a Docker image from our code. Before Lab Test can biuld the Docker image, our components must be built. How are we going to tell Lab Test to build our components?

We need two things: a *build image* and a *build command.*

To build the components, Lab Test checks out the code (using :ref:`code_repo_url_config_option`), runs the *build image* and mounts the code directory to the ``/build/`` directory inside the container. Lab Test runs the *build command*  inside the *build image,* not affecting anything else on the server. However, anything done to the ``/build/`` directory passes through to the Test Server file system.


Build image
-----------

The *build image* is a general Docker image that has all the tools pre-installed to build our components. We need a node.js environment, so referring to :ref:`automating-the-app-build-process` we add ``"app_build_image": "drydock/u16nodall"`` to our configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript
    :caption: Adding ``app_build_image`` to ``package.json``

    {
      "name": "vizwiz",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A data visualization widget library",
      // other stuff here
      "labtest": {
        "app_name": "vizwiz",
        "host": "test",
        "use_ssh_config": true,
        "test_domain": "digital-test.boston.gov",
        "code_repo_url": "git@github.com:CityOfBoston/vizwiz.git",
        "app_build_image": "drydock/u16nodall"
      }
    }


Build command
-------------

The *build command* is what it takes to build our component. We like to create a small Bash script that runs the commands we need. We create a ``buildapp`` script in our project directory.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: The ``buildapp`` script

    #!/bin/bash

    nvm use 8
    yarn install
    yarn run build

We happen to know that the ``u16nodall`` uses ``nvm`` to select its node environment. We then need to install our packages and run the ``build`` script with ``yarn``\ .

We make this script executable (on MacOS and Linux, anyway) with the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ chmod a+x buildapp

Now we add ``"app_build_command": "./buildapp"`` to our configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript
    :caption: Adding ``app_build_command`` to ``package.json``

    {
      "name": "vizwiz",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A data visualization widget library",
      // other stuff here
      "labtest": {
        "app_name": "vizwiz",
        "host": "test",
        "use_ssh_config": true,
        "test_domain": "digital-test.boston.gov",
        "code_repo_url": "git@github.com:CityOfBoston/vizwiz.git",
        "app_build_image": "drydock/u16nodall",
        "app_build_command": "./buildapp"
      }
    }


Playing in your build environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to play with the build container to see what it can do, you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker run --rm -ti drydock/u16nodall

and you will drop into a Bash shell in your build environment. If you want to mount your code in this environment use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:/build -w /build drydock/u16nodall

This mounts the current working directory into ``/build`` and makes that your starting working directory.

:note: These are **big** images. Be prepared for a several GB download.


Are we ready?
=============

So are we ready? We can double check by running ``labtest check-config``\ .

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Running the ``labtest check-config`` command

    $ labtest check-config
    The configuration is valid.

    Configuration:
      build_provider: default
      verbose: False
      app_name: vizwiz
      environment: []
      container_build_command: docker build -t $APP_NAME/$INSTANCE_NAME --build-arg RELEASE=$RELEASE --build-arg APP_NAME=$APP_NAME --build-arg BRANCH_NAME=$BRANCH_NAME --build-arg INSTANCE_NAME=$INSTANCE_NAME .
      host: test
      app_build_command: ./buildapp
      test_domain: digital-test.boston.gov
      docker_image_pattern: %(APP_NAME)s/%(INSTANCE_NAME)s:latest
      app_build_image: drydock/u16nodall
      use_ssh_config: True
      config_file_path: /Users/coordt/Projects/vizwiz/package.json
      code_repo_url: git@github.com:CityOfBoston/vizwiz.git
      host_name_pattern: %(APP_NAME)s-%(INSTANCE_NAME)s
      container_provider: local

Everything is ready *locally.* We still haven't committed anything to the repo!

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Adding the new stuff to the repo

    $ git add package.json buildapp Dockerfile .dockerignore
    $ git commit -m"Added labtest stuff"
    [labtest 488ea92] Added labtest stuff
     4 files changed, 23 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 .dockerignore
     create mode 100644 Dockerfile

    $ git push

Now that our master branch has the configuration, we can make new any branch into an experiment.

Making an experiment
====================

We can create an experiment but running ``labtest create <branchname>``\ . We'll create a new branch named ``foo`` and create an experiment from it.

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Running the ``labtest create`` command

    $ git checkout -b foo
    Switched to a new branch 'foo'
    $ git push
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To github.com:CityOfBoston/vizwiz.git
     * [new branch]      foo -> foo
    $ labtest create foo
    [test] Executing task 'create_instance'
    Building the application using drydock/u16nodall and ./buildapp.
    [test] put: <file obj> -> /testing/vizwiz/foo/docker-build
    [test] put: <file obj> -> /testing/vizwiz/foo/test.env
    [test] put: <file obj> -> /tmp/vizwiz-foo.service

    Your experiment is available at: vizwiz-foo.digital-test.boston.gov

**Success!!** Our experiment is available at ``vizwiz-labtest.digital-test.boston.gov``\ . Each experiment's URL is created using the template ``<app_name>-<instance_name>.<test_domain>``\ , although you can configure this via :ref:`host_name_pattern_config_option`.

:note: That URL is only for the purposes of this tutorial. It doesn't work.

:note: Lab Test's commands are `idempotent`_. You can run the same command over and over without harm.

.. _idempotent: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence


Updating the experiment
=======================

Having an experiment out there is nice, but what if you make changes in the branch?

Let's do that. We made a simple but noticeable change to the base template:

.. figure::  images/tutorial-before.png
    :alt: The page before the change

    The page before the change

.. figure::  images/tutorial-after.png
    :alt: The page after the change

    The page after the change

All we have to do is commit and push the changes in our branch, and then tell Lab Test to update our experiment with ``labtest update <experiment name>``\ :

.. code-block:: console
    :caption:   Modifying VizWiz and updating the experiment

    $ git add index-template.html
    $ git commit -m"Updating for lab test tutorial"
    [labtest bd5d845] Updating for lab test tutorial
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
    $ git push
    Counting objects: 3, done.
    Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 312 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
    To github.com:CityOfBoston/vizwiz.git
       ff97119..bd5d845  foo -> foo
    $ labtest update foo
    [test] Executing task 'update_instance'
    Building the application using drydock/u16nodall and ./buildapp.
    [test] put: <file obj> -> /testing/vizwiz/foo/docker-build
    [test] put: <file obj> -> /testing/vizwiz/foo/test.env

Updating should take less time than creating. Depending on your *build command,* it will use the cached packages installed previously.

Deleting the experiment
=======================

When we are done with the experiment, we simply delete it with ``labtest delete <experiment name>``\ :

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Deleting an experiment

    $ labtest delete foo
    [test] Executing task 'delete_instance'

Lab Test cleans up the test server as if the experiment never happened.
