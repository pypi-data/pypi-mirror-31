upgrade:
  - |
    The Undercloud upgrade is now done via host_prep_tasks in the docker services, driven
    by tripleoclient when containerizing the Undercloud.
    Note that the crontabs that were not managed by Puppet (e.g. custom crontabs) for the
    openstack services (cinder, heat, keystone and nova) will be removed and need to be
    containerized or re-added manually after the upgrade.
