﻿Auto Remove Torrents
======================
|TravisCI| |MIT|

This script can help you to remove your torrents. Now you don't need to worry about your disk space - according to your strategies, for each category and tracker, the script will check each torrent if it satisfies the remove condition; If so, delete it automatically.

This smart script supports qBittorrent/Transmission/μTorrent. If you like, star it :sparkles: :)

Requirements
-------------
* Python 3

That's all. It's a simple but smart script.


Installation
-------------
Download the codes
+++++++++++++++++++
::

    git clone https://github.com/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents.git
    pip3 install requests pyyaml
    cd autoremove-torrents


Write your configuration file
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In order to satisfactory your needs, you have to learn how to write a configuration file. The grammar is quite easy, for example::

    vim ./config.yml

::

    my_task:
      client: qbittorrent
      host: http://127.0.0.1
      username: admin
      password: adminadmin
      strategies:
        my_strategy:
          categories:
            - IPT
          seeding_time: 1209600
          ratio: 1
      delete_data: true


The script will delete those torrents whose categories are IPT, seeding time is above 1209600 seconds **or** ratio is greater than 1. Visit `Wiki`_ to learn more.

.. _Wiki: https://github.com/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/wiki

Run
++++
::

    python3 main.py

If you just want to see which torrents can be removed but don't want to really remove them, use --view command line argument.


Setting up scheduled tasks
-----------------------------
If you want to check whether there is any torrent can be removed every 15 minutes, the crontab can help you. Look at the example::

    crontab -e

And then, add a line at the end of the file (please confirm the path of the python3 and your script)::

*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/main.py --conf=/home/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/config.yml

The *conf=* indicates the path to the configuration file.


Changelog
----------
Wed, 28 Mar 2018: (Correct document) The *delete_data* field shouldn't be indented.

Thu, 22 Mar 2018: First version :bowtie:

TODO List
-----------
Depend on users' feedback.

* Support Deluge and rtorrent in the future

* Add remove condition: Disk free space

* Add remove condition: Max/Min average UL/DL speed

* The file *autoremove.py* is too long to maintain, I should reconstruct it using OOP.

If you have any problem, please submit `Issues`_.
