* Unix + Windows Support ðŸ’–


Stable Release
--------------

To install Pipenv Pipes, run this command in your terminal:

MacOs + Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install pipenv-pipes --user

Windows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install pipenv-pipes --find-links https://github.com/gtalarico/curses-win/releases/tag/2.2.0

This is the preferred method to install Pipenv Pipes,
as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_
can guide you through the process.

Known Issues
------------

``PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT`` is not currently supported.
If have ideas on how Pipes could support local venvs please start
with the proposed implementation.


Curses on Windows
-----------------

The interactive selector uses Curses, and  is not natively supported on windows.
To enable curses on Windows we must install additional Windows binaries,
which were obtained from `here <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses>`_

The installer should automatically install the windows curses binaries, for should you need to install
them manually, just download the appropriate wheel from the link above and then use pip to install it:


.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install ..packetPath..\curses-2.2-cp35-none-win_amd64.whl

You can read more about windows support for curses here:

Terminal
~~~~~~~~

While Pipes should work on the standard terminal (cmd.exe)
a terminal like `Cmder`_ is highly recommended over cmd.
