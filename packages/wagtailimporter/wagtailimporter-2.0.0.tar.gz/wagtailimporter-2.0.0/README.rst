    !custom_snippet
        slug: my-snippet
        title: My Snippet

Foreign Object References
-------------------------

Instead of having to resolve foreign keys (yuck!) you can pass Yaml objects
to create references, e.g. `!page` takes arguments that are used to reference
a page (by path `url`).

Builtin reference types:

* ``!page``

  Takes a `url` parameter to another page (must be already present).

* ``!image``

  Takes a `file` parameter to an image (either in `MEDIA/original/images`.

  Can also accept other `Image` related parameters such as `title`.

* ``!document``

  Takes a `file` parameter to a document (e.g. a PDF) - not to be confused with a yaml 'document'.

  Also accepts a `title` paramater (recommended for a better admin experience)

* ``!site``

  Lookup a `Site` by its `hostname`.

  Can also create sites if you specify `root_page` (as a `!page`).

  ::

      !site
          hostname: localhost
          site_name: My Site
          root_page: !page
              url: /my-site
          is_default_site: true

* All registered Wagtail settings, using ``!app.mysetting``

  ::

      !app.socialmedialinks:
          site: !site
              hostname: localhost
          facebook_url: https://www.facebook.com/squareweave/

You can also create your own for your models:

::

    import wagtailimporter.serializer

    class Toplevel(wagtailimporter.serializer.GetOrCreateForeignObject):
        """A reference to a toplevel"""
        yaml_tag = '!toplevel'
        model = TopLevel

The following base classes are provided:

* `GetForeignObject`

  Calls `get` on an object defined by `lookup_keys`.

* `GetOrCreateForeignObject` (inherits from `GetForeignObject`)

  Calls `get_or_create` as above.

* `GetOrCreateClusterableForeignObject` (inherits from `GetForeignObject`)

  Calls `get` or creates a new, unsaved object
  (useful for `ClusterableModel` related classes).

  For example:

  ::

      url: /my/page
      type: some.type
      related_pages:
          - !relatedpage
                page: !page
                    url: /my/other/page

  ::

      class RelatedPage(Orderable):
          """A related page."""

          parent = ParentalKey(SiteSettings, related_name='related_pages')
          page = models.ForeignKey('wagtailcore.Page',
                                   null=True, blank=True,
                                   on_delete=models.CASCADE,
                                   related_name='+')

          panels = [
              PageChooserPanel('page'),
          ]


      class RelatedPageTag(GetOrCreateClusterableForeignObject):

          model = RelatedPage
          yaml_tag = '!relatedpage'
          lookup_keys = ('page',)


Importing snippets
------------------

Foreign object references can also be used to create and import snippets.

::

    !custom_snippet
        slug: my-snippet
        title: My Snippet

::

    import wagtailimporter.serializer

    class MySnippet(wagtailimporter.serializer.GetOrCreateForeignObject):
        """Creates a snippet"""
        yaml_tag = '!my-snippet'
        model = MySnippet

        lookup_keys = ('slug',)
