Description: Typical use is:
        
            import textinput
            for line in textinput.lines():
                process(line)
        
        This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:],
        defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty.  If a filename is '-' it
        is also replaced by sys.stdin.  To specify an alternative list of
        filenames, pass it as the argument to input().  A single file name is
        also allowed.
