    """
    Defines an object to store the location that we requesting data for. Using this class instead of just passing
    a str allows us to provide additional guidance as to the acceptable/required members of a proper location.
    Also, the location_str method allows us to generate the most accurate location based on the data the user provides.

    The location can be defined in one of three ways:
        - provide both latitude and longitude
        or
        - provide both ciy and state
        or
        provide a postal code (US or Canada only)
