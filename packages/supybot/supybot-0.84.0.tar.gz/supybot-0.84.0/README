# Supybot is dead, long live Limnoria

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... Supybot was maintained.

For years, there have been idle threats of that happening again, but it has not
come to pass.

Instead, various friendly forks were created, with
[Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) seeming to have the most
momentum.  Under the watchful eye of Valentin "ProgVal" Lorentz, a successful
community has developed and worked to shepherd Supybot onward.
