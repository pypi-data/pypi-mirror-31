Description: # Engine
        
        Engine is a simple game engine made using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).  
        One of the purposes of this engine is for making easier the use of Pygame to build more complex games.  
        This engine includes support for collisions, meshes, materials, game objects and scenes.  
        The elements used are very similar to the ones used in the engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com/ "Unity Official Website").
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine if you use Linux. 
        Instructions for Windows and Mac are similar.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        You will just have to install Pygame. The instructions below will show you how to do this for Linux (Ubuntu 16.04).
        
        First, install Python3 setup tools and pip:
        
        ```
        $ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
        $ sudo easy_install3 pip
        ```
        
        Then install Pygame using pip:
        
        ```
        $ sudo pip3.5 install pygame
        ```
