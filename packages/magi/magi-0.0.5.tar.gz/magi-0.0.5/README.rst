Overview
============

`magi` is intended to be a high level python wrapper around other time series forecasting libraries to allow easily parallelized univariate time series forecasting in python. In particular, the library current supports wrappers around the 
R `forecast <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.3>`_ library and 
facebook's `prophet <https://github.com/facebook/prophet>`_ package


Basic Usage
============

Use Cases
============

What this package should be used for
------------
* 1 or more Univariate Time Series forecasting
* forecasting using many different time series models in parallel with minimal effort
* wrapper for R forecast library to implement those models in python workflow
* wrapper around Prophet library to provide easier data framework to work with
* single source of access for many different time series forecasting models 

What this package should NOT be used for
------------
* Multivariate Time Series data. If you have multiple x variables that are correlated with your response variable, I'd suggest simply using regression with lags and seasonal variable to account for autocorrelation in your error
* Data exploration - The time series analysis step is much more suited to using the R forecast package directly

Dependencies
============
* dask
* distributed
* plotly
* cufflinks
* rpy2 (& forecast package >=8.3 installed in R)
* fbprophet


Installation
============

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install magi

Disclaimer
============
This package is still very early in development and should not be relied upon in production. Everything is still subject to change
