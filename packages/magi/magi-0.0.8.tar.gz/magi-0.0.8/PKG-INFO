        Overview
        ============
        
        `magi` is intended to be a high level python wrapper around other time series forecasting libraries to allow easily parallelized univariate time series forecasting in python. In particular, the library current supports wrappers around the 
        R `forecast <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.3>`_ library and 
        facebook's `prophet <https://github.com/facebook/prophet>`_ package
        
        
        Basic Usage
        ============
        
        Use Cases
        ============
        
        What this package should be used for
        ------------
        * forecasting for 1 or more Univariate Time Series
        * forecasting using many different time series models in parallel with minimal effort
        * wrapper for R forecast library to implement those models in python workflow
        * wrapper around Prophet library to provide easier data framework to work with
        * single source of access for many different time series forecasting models 
        
        What this package should NOT be used for
        ------------
        * Multivariate Time Series data. If you have multiple x variables that are correlated with your response variable, I'd suggest simply using regression with lags and seasonal variable to account for autocorrelation in your error
        * Data exploration - The time series analysis step is much more suited to using the R forecast package directly
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        * dask
        * distributed
        * plotly
        * cufflinks
        * rpy2 (& forecast package >=8.3 installed in R)
        * fbprophet
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install magi

        Disclaimer
        ============
        This package is still very early in development and should not be relied upon in production. Everything is still subject to change
