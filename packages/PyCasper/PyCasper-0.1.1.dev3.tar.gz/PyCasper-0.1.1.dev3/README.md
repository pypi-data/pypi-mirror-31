# Casper
some random functions/classes which serve a utilitarian purpose in multiple projects
PS: Hierarchy of Classes will change as I add more utilities 

## Installing
* From PyPI
```sh
pip install pycasper
```

* From Source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chahuja/pycasper.git
cd pycasper
python setup.py install
```

## ProtoTyping 
### Name (When finding unique names becomes a bigger task than the task itself)
* Based on a Namespace of arguments and its values, `Name` creates a unique name.
* If all arguments are too much for the length of the name, it is possible to provide a subset of those arguments
* Read more in the docfile of the class Name

## Results
* Coming soon...
