Blurr transforms `raw data` into `features` for model training and prediction using a `high-level expressive YAML-based language` called the Data Transform Configuration (DTC).

For production ML applications, __experimentation__ and __iteration speed__ is important. Working directly with raw data provides the most flexibility. Blurr allows product teams to iterate quickly during ML dev and provides a self-service way to take experiments to production.

>Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. 'Applied machine learning' is basically feature engineering

# DTC at a glance

Raw data like this

```javascript
{ "user_id": "09C1", "session_id": "915D", "country" : "US", "event_id": "game_start" }
{ "user_id": "09C1", "session_id": "915D", "country" : "US", "event_id": "game_end", "won": 1 }
{ "user_id": "09C1", "session_id": "915D", "country" : "US", "event_id": "game_start" }
{ "user_id": "09C1", "session_id": "915D", "country" : "US", "event_id": "game_end", "won": 1 }
{ "user_id": "B6FA", "session_id": "D043", "country" : "US", "event_id": "game_start" }
{ "user_id": "B6FA", "session_id": "D043", "country" : "US", "event_id": "game_end", "won": 1 }
{ "user_id": "09C1", "session_id": "T8KA", "country" : "UK", "event_id": "game_start" }
{ "user_id": "09C1", "session_id": "T8KA", "country" : "UK", "event_id": "game_end", "won": 1 }
```

turns into

session_id |  user_id | games_played | games_won
--- | ------------ | -------------- | --------
915D | 09C1 | 2 | 2
D043 | B6FA | 1 | 1
T8KA | 09C1 | 1 | 1

using this DTC

```yaml

Type: Blurr:Transform:Streaming
Version: '2018-03-01'
Name : sessions

Stores:
   - Type: Blurr:Store:MemoryStore
     Name: hello_world_store

Identity: source.user_id

Time: parser.parse(source.timestamp)

Aggregates:

 - Type: Blurr:Aggregate:BlockAggregate
   Name: session_stats
   Store: hello_world_store

   Split: source.session_id != session_stats.session_id

   Fields:

     - Name: session_id
       Type: string
       Value: source.session_id

     - Name: games_played
       Type: integer
       When: source.event_id == 'game_start'
       Value: session_stats.games_played + 1

     - Name: games_won
       Type: integer
       When: source.event_id == 'game_end' and source.won == '1'
       Value: session_stats.games_won + 1

# Use Blurr

We interact with Blurr using a Command Line Interface (CLI). Blurr is installed via pip:

`$ pip install blurr`

Transform data

```
$ blurr transform \
     --streaming-dtc ./dtcs/sessionize-dtc.yml \
     --window-dtc ./dtcs/windowing-dtc.yml \
     --source file://path
```

# Data Science 'Joel Test'

Inspired by the (old school) [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) to rate software teams, here's our version for data science teams. What's your score? We'd love to know!

1. Data pipelines are versioned and reproducible
2. Pipelines (re)build in one step
3. Deploying to production needs minimal engineering help
4. Successful ML is a long game. You play it like it is
5. Kaizen. Experimentation and iterations are a way of life
