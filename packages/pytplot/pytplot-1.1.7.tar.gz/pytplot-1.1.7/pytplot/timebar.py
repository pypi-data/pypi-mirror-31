    """
    This function will add a vertical bar to all time series plots.  This is useful if you
    want to bring attention to a specific time.  
    
    Parameters:
        t : flt/list
            The time in seconds since Jan 01 1970 to place the vertical bar.  If a list of numbers are supplied,
            multiple bars will be created.  If "databar" is set, then "t" becomes the point on the y axis to 
            place a horizontal bar.  
        varname : str/list, optional
            The variable(s) to add the vertical bar to.  If not set, the default is to add it to all current plots.  
        databar : bool, optional
            This will turn the timebar into a horizontal data bar.  If this is set True, then variable "t" becomes 
            the point on the y axis to place a horizontal bar.  
        delete : bool, optional
            If set to True, at lease one varname must be supplied.  The timebar at point "t" for variable "varname"
            will be removed.  
        color : str
            The color of the bar
        thick : int
            The thickness of the bar
        dash : bool
            If set to True, the bar is dashed rather than solid
            
    Returns:
        None
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Place a green time bar at 2017-07-17 00:00:00
        >>> import pytplot
        >>> pytplot.timebar(1500249600, color='grean)
        
        >>> # Place a dashed data bar at 5500 on the y axis
        >>> pytplot.timebar(5500, dashed=True, databar=True)
