        EZSpot - the spot management tool help you to use AWS EC2 spot instance easily. 
        
        ## Features
        
        1. Start workload as multi spot fleets
            - If some of fleets can not start, the whole workload will rollback.
            - Rollback will clean all resources which create by EZSpot.

        2. Stop workload by terminate all spot fleets behind by workload tag.
        3. Auto associate EIP to all workload spot instance and manage EIP lifecycle.
        4. Log file output under '~/.ezspot/log'
