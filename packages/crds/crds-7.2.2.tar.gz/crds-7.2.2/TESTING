As of version 7.0.7 CRDS test data has been restructured to support testing on
Travis CI and sites with no access to /grp/crds/cache.

Setting up CRDS to run the built-in unit tests can be accomplished as follows:

    % git checkout https://github.com/spacetelescope/crds.git CRDS
    % cd CRDS
    % setenv CRDS_SERVER_URL https://hst-crds.stsci.edu
    % setup_test_cache $HOME   # You need at least 1G of space for this
    % ./runtests

If you wish to relocate your CRDS test caches somewhere other than $HOME
do:

    % setup_test_cache <somewhere else>
    % setenv CRDS_TEST_ROOT <somewhere else>
    % ./runtests

The above configures CRDS to run the built-in unit tests using several file
sources:

- $CRDS_TEST_ROOT/crds-cache-test           
  Dirty test cache with corrupted/hacked files, used by tests only.
  Has the dangerous property of like-named files with different contents.

- $CRDS_TEST_ROOT/crds-cache-default-test    
  Used when CRDS_PATH not set,  replaces /grp/crds/cache with minimal reference files for testing
  /grp/crds/cache is a complete HST + JWST readonly cache on the Central Store,  too large to distribute

- $HOME/crds_cache_ops
  For CRDS_PATH set by hst-crds-ops.csh,  used whenever tests don't clear CRDS_PATH

- CRDS/crds/tests/data
  Ad hoc test data files used with explicit paths
  CRDS/crds/test/data is normally omitted from source code distributions.
