Description: # datasette-cluster-map
        
        A [Datasette plugin](http://datasette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html) that detects tables with `latitude` and `longitude` columns and then plots them on a map using [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster).
        
        ## Demo
        
        https://datasette-cluster-map-demo.now.sh/ hosts a demo of this plugin running against several different tables.

        ## Installation
        
        Run `pip install datasette-cluster-map` to add this plugin to your Datasette virtual environment. Datasette will automatically include the plugin if it is installed in this way.
        
        If you are deploying using the `datasette publish` command you can use the `--install` option:
        
            datasette publish now mydb.db --install=datasette-cluster-map
        
        If any of your tables have a `latitude` and `longitude` column, a map will be automatically displayed.
        
        If you columns are called something else you can still get the map to display by using a custom SQL query to alias those columns to `latitude` and `longitude`, for example:
        
            select name, lat as latitude, lng as longitude from my_table
