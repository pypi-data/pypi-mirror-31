        Sumo is a Python toolkit for plotting and analysing VASP calculations. The main features include:
        
        1. An extensive framework for generating high-symmetry k-point paths.
        2. Plotting scripts for electronic and phonon band structures, density of states, and optical absorption.
        3. Analysis scripts to calculate band edge effective masses.
        
        Sumo is built on pymatgen, meaning there is no effort required to read and write typical VASP files.
        Sumo is free to use, however, we welcome your help in improving and extending the
        package with your own contributions.
        
        Warning: There are probably still some bugs. If you think you've find any,
        please report them on the Issue Tracker.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Primarily, sumo is intended to be used via the command-line, however, a fully-documented
        python API is also provided.
        A full manual, including tutorials and API documentation,
        is `available online <http://sumo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
        Additionally, the built-in help (``-h``) option for each command provides a
        summary of the available options.
        
        Currently the scripts provided by sumo are:
        
        - ``sumo-kgen``: For generating VASP KPOINTS files along high-symmetry k-point paths.
        - ``sumo-bandplot``: For plotting publication-ready electronic band structure diagrams.
        - ``sumo-dosplot``: For plotting publication-ready electronic density of state diagrams.
        - ``sumo-optplot``: For plotting publication-ready optical absorption plots.
        - ``sumo-phonon-bandplot``: For plotting publication-ready phonon band structure diagrams.
        - ``sumo-bandstats``: For calculating electron and hole effective masses from a band structure.
        
        A guide to using each command can be found on the
        `Tutorial page <http://sumo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>`_.
        
        For a preview of the functionality of sumo, see the
        `Gallery <http://sumo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        We recommend installation from source with Pip, this will automatically install any dependencies:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install --user sumo
        
        To build the documentation, download the package source and install with extra dependecies:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install --user .[docs]
            cd docs
            make html
        
        Developer installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Developers may prefer to install using ``pip3 install --user -e .`` which
        creates an "editable" local installation. Instead of copying files,
        this creates links to the source folder so that that tweaks to the
        code in your source folder will be immediately reflected on the PATH.
        
        Tests
        ~~~~~
        
        To ensure the code has been installed correctly, the unittests can be run using::
        
          python -m unittest discover tests
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Sumo is currently compatible with Python 3.5+ and relies on a number of
        open-source python packages, specifically:
        
        - Pymatgen
        - Numpy
        - Scipy
        - Matplotlib
        - Spglib
        - Phonopy
        - SeeK-path
        - H5py (optional dependency for phonon plotting features)
        
        Sumo uses Pip and setuptools for installation. You *probably* already
        have this; if not, your GNU/Linux package manager will be able to oblige
        with a package named something like ``python-setuptools``. On Max OSX
        the Python distributed with `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_. includes
        setuptools and Pip.
