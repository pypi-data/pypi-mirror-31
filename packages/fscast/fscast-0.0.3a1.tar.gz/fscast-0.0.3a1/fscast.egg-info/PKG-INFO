Description: Cast
        ====
        
            command line app for file system templates.
        
        Cast can modify the structure of multiple directories at once. Provided
        these directories are registered for a common template - moving,
        renaming or deleting folders from that template will apply those changes
        to the directories (called instances of the template).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Linux:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            git clone https://github.com/taesko/cast.git
            cd cast
            pip install .
        
        NOTE: This project has only been tested on linux. Installation is no
        different on other OS provided git and pip are installed, but it's not
        guaranteed to work properly.
        
        Usage example
        -------------
        
        Use any existing directory to make a template out of it.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cast add template_name ./dir_path
        
        Register any other directory to that template as it's instance
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cast register template_name /directory/we/want/registered
        
        If the directory's structure is not conformed to the template's an error
        is raised. That is the instance must contain directories with the same
        as the template's. (it is OK for the instance to have other directories
        as well)
        
        Create additional directories inside a template:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cast add -m template_name various dir_names dir_names/similar to mkdir arguments
        
        Rename a directory inside a template
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cast mv template_name relative_src_path relative_dst_path
        
        Remove a directory from a template
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cast rm template_name multiple relative/directory/paths
        
        Commands that modify a templates structure all take the name of the
        template as a first argument and relative paths (considered from the
        root of the template not the current working directory) to the desired
        directories as additional arguments. Moving and renaming directories by
        default applies the same changes to instances of the template as well
        but this is not true for removing directories.
        
        For full information:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cast --help
        
        Development setup
        -----------------
        
        There is no development branch (yet) and setup is nearly identical to
        user installation.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            git clone https://github.com/taesko/cast.git
            cd cast
            pip install -e .
