**Note**: This project is currently under development. Version 0.1.0 will be the first, fully documented alpha release.

Use law to build complex and large-scale task workflows. It is build on top of `luigi <https://github.com/spotify/luigi>`_ and adds abstractions for **run locations**, **storage locations** and **software environments**. Law strictly disentangles these building blocks and ensures they remain interchangeable and resource-opportunistic.

Key features:

- CLI with auto-completion and interactive status and dependency inspection.
- Remote targets with automatic retries and local caching
   - WebDAV, HTTP, Dropbox, SFTP, all WLCG protocols (srm, xrootd, rfio, dcap, gsiftp, ...)
- Automatic submission to batch systems from within tasks
   - HTCondor, LSF, gLite, ARC
- Environment sandboxing, configurable on task level
   - Docker, Singularity, Sub-Shells

First steps
===========

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

Install via `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/law>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install law

This command also installs `luigi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/luigi>`_ and `six <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`_.

Remote targets also require `gfal2 <http://dmc.web.cern.ch/projects/gfal-2/home>`_ and `gfal2-python <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gfal2-python>`_ (also via pip) to be installed.
