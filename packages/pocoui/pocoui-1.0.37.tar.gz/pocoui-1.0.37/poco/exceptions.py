    In most cases, there is no need to handle this exception manually. If this exception occurs, it usually means it
    is a bug in your code rather than application itself. Check your code first. The most of misuses comes from as
    follows.
    
    Examples:
        ::

            button1 = poco('button1')
            time.sleep(10)   # waiting for long enough before the UI hierarchy changing
