```

## Basic usage with example for a pre-defined case or a suited one

```
python app.py
```

or you can build a binary

```
bazel build :app
```

After that you can execute

```
./bazel-bin/app
```

### Properties available to activate as arguments

```

## Thinking on relations like test

```
python app_test.py
```

or just doing the same to produce a binary in another way

```
bazel build :app_test
```

For tests too, you can have an access of that binary

```
./bazel-bin/app_test
```
