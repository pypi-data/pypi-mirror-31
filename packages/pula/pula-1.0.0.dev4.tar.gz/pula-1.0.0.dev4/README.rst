What
----

"Pula" stands for Python Useful Library Add-on.  It is a module built for Python 3 that acts as a compendium for the generic functions that most users find themselves needing through their various projects. This library is independent of discipline and is meant for everyone.

The functions that this module covers will continue to grow as more functions are submitted by users and developers. These functions can be as simple as a is_number function all the way to more complex text / code scrapping of files in a directory.

The only caveat is that these functions be generic enough that more than one discipline can use them. This is due to the fact that having very project specific functions should be included in a project specific module.

This module is entirely written in Python 3.

The package and API documentation will come soon.


Installation
------------

For most users, we recommended method to install is via pip::

    pip install pula

Users can also download the PyPi package from 
`Pula on PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/pula/#files>`_
and install it manually.


Development
-----------

This module is meant to be a community project and we are looking for 
user input on new functions that can be added.
