Description: 
        Pula is a python library that is meant to encompass the many various functions that the ordinary user
        finds themselves needing in the different projects they are working on. These functions can span from 
        simple is_number functions all the way to file functions such as getting all lines of text from a directory 
        of code / text files.
        
        By putting all of these functions into one library, we hope to clean up other users code and make solving 
        their problems easier as well as more efficient.
