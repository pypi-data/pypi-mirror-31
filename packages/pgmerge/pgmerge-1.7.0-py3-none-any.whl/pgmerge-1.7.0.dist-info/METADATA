pgmerge - a PostgreSQL data import and merge utility
====================================================

This utility will read CSV files and *merge* each CSV's rows into a
table of a PostgreSQL database. The merge process means that it will:

-  Import rows whose primary key doesn't yet exist.
-  Update row values when the primary key already exists.
-  Ignore unchanged or missing rows.

This is also called an *upsert* operation as it performs either an
update or an insert.

pgmerge can also export data in the same format expected for import.

These features allow you to move data between databases to keep them up
to date and in sync, although it does not cover handling deleted data.

::

    $ pgmerge --help
    Usage: pgmerge [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Merges data in CSV files into a Postgresql database.

    Options:
    --version  Show the version and exit.
    --help     Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
    export  Export each table to a CSV file.
    import  Import/merge each CSV file into a table.
    inspect  Inspect database schema in various ways.

Import
~~~~~~

::

    $ pgmerge import --help
    Usage: pgmerge import [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY [TABLES]...

    Import/merge each CSV file into a table.

    All CSV files need the same name as their matching table and have to be located in the given directory.
    If one or more tables are specified then only they will be used, otherwise all tables found will
    be selected.

    Options:
    -d, --dbname TEXT               Database name to connect to.  [required]
    -h, --host TEXT                 Database server host or socket directory.  [default: localhost]
    -p, --port TEXT                 Database server port.  [default: 5432]
    -U, --username TEXT             Database user name.  [default: postgres]
    -s, --schema TEXT               Database schema to use.  [default: public]
    -W, --password TEXT             Database password (default is to prompt for password or read config).
    -f, --disable-foreign-keys      Disable foreign key constraint checking during import (necessary if you have
                                    cycles, but requires superuser rights).
    -c, --config PATH               Config file for customizing how tables are imported/exported.
    -i, --include-dependent-tables  When selecting specific tables, also include all tables that depend on those
                                    tables due to foreign key constraints.
    --help                          Show this message and exit.
