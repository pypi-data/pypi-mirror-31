	"""
	A generator which at each step takes a contour and either finds 
	all the zeros of f within it or subdivides it further.  Based
	on the algorithm in [KB]

	Parameters
	----------
	originalContour : Contour
		The contour C which bounds the region in which all the 
		roots of f(z) are sought.
	f : function
		A function of a single complex variable, z, which is 
		analytic within C and has no poles or roots on C.
	df : function, optional
		A function of a single complex variable which is the 
		derivative of the function f(z). If df is not given 
		then it will be approximated with a finite difference 
		formula.
	guessRoots : list, optional
		A list of known roots or, if the multiplicity is known, 
		a list of (root, multiplicity) tuples.
	guessRootSymmetry : function, optional
		A function of a single complex variable, z, which 
		returns a list of all points which are expected to be 
		roots of f, given that z is a root of f.
	newtonStepTol : float, optional
		The required accuracy of the root.
		The iterative method used to give a final value for each
		root will exit if the step size, dx, between sucessive 
		iterations satisfies abs(dx) < newtonStepTol and iterBestAttempt
		is False.
	attemptIterBest : bool, optional
		If True then the iterative method used to refine the roots will exit 
		when error of the previous iteration, x0, was at least as good as the 
		current iteration, x, in the sense that abs(f(x)) >= abs(f(x0)) and 
		the previous iteration satisfied abs(dx0) < newtonStepTol.In this 
		case the preivous iteration is returned as the approximation of the root.
	newtonMaxIter : int, optional
		The iterative method used to give a final value for each
		root will exit if the number of iterations exceeds newtonMaxIter.
	rootErrTol : float, optional
		A complex value z is considered a root if abs(f(z)) < rootErrTol
	absTol : float, optional
		Absolute error tolerance used by the contour integration.
	relTol : float, optional
		Relative error tolerance used by the contour integration.
	integerTol : float, optional
		A number is considered an integer if it is within 
		integerTol of an integer.  Used when determing if the
		value for the number of roots within a contour and the
		values of the computed multiplicities of roots are
		acceptably close to integers.
	NintAbsTol : float, optional
		The absolute error tolerance used for the contour 
		integration when determining the number of roots 
		within a contour.  Since the result of this integration
		must be an integer it can be much less accurate
		than usual.
	M : int, optional
		If the number of roots (including multiplicites) within a
		contour is greater than M then the contour is subdivided
		further.  M must be greater than or equal to the largest 
		multiplcity of any root.  
	errStop : float, optional
		The number of distinct roots within a contour, n, is 
		determined by checking if all the elements of a list of 
		contour integrals involving formal orthogonal polynomials 
		are sufficently close to zero, ie. that the absolute 
		value of each element is < errStop.
	intMethod : str, optional
		Either 'quad' to integrate using scipy.integrate.quad or
		'romb' to integrate using Romberg's method.
	divMax : int, optional
		If the Romberg integration method is used then divMax is the
		maximum number of divisions before the Romberg integration
		routine of a path exits.
	divMin : int, optional
		If the Romberg integration method is used then divMin is the
		minimum number of divisions before the Romberg integration
		routine of a path is allowed to exit.
    m : int, optional
    	Only used if df=None.  If method='romb' then m defines the stencil size for the 
    	numerical differentiation of f, passed to numdifftools.fornberg.fd_derivative.
    	The stencil size is of 2*m+1 points in the interior, and 2*m+2 points for each 
    	of the 2*m boundary points.  If instead method='quad' then m must is the order of 
    	the error term in the Taylor approximation used which must be even.  The argument
    	order=m is passed to numdifftools.Derivative.
	verbose : bool, optional
		If True certain messages concerning the rootfinding process
		will be printed.

	Yields
	------
	list
		Roots of f(z) within the contour C
	list
		Multiplicites of roots
	deque
		The contours which still contain roots
	int
		Remaining number of roots to be found within the contour
