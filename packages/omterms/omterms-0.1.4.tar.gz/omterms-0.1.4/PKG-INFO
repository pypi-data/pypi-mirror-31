        --------------
        
        The first objective of this module is to provide a customizable and
        standardized text preprocessing prior to further analyses where more
        advanced machine learning and or statistical techniques can be applied
        and compared with each other. In that sense, it provides a pipelined set
        of functionalities (i) to be able to inspect, organize, prune and merge
        texts around one or very few specific theme(s) or topic(s), (ii) remove
        unwanted terms or literals from the texts, (iii) tokenize the texts,
        (iv) count the terms in texts, and (v) when desired stem the tokenized
        terms.
        
        The second objective of this module is to be able compare or score a
        foreground corpus or a specific corpus against a background corpus or
        reference corpus. Example use cases could be, for instance, exploring
        the language of a sub-culture, a community, or a movement looking at to
        what extend the specific use of the language of the group differentiates
        itself from the common language.
        
        In cases when there are more than a few number of themes or topics, and
        where each topic is represented with a large set of documents that
        validates the employment of standardized matrix decomposition based
        methodologies, then the scoring option of this module can be skipped
        entirely. More specifically, in use cases where the objective is being
        able to classify and differentiate a number of topics or issues from
        each other and where there are sufficient data that fulfills the
        underlining assumptions of NMF, LDA or LSI based approaches, then tools
        from, for instance, Python’s
        `sklearn.decomposition <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#non-negative-matrix-factorization-nmf-or-nnmf>`__
        package are suggested.
        
        Nevertheless, the outputs of this module, such as its normalized term
        frequencies or the specificity scores it associates to them regarding to
        a reference background corpus, can be used as input to other matrix
        decomposition techniques.

        Roadmap on Keyword and Keyphrase Extraction
        ===========================================
        
        The method outlined here aims to set-up a base line for future
        improvements.
        
        -  It uses a statistical approach combined with standardized procedures
           that are widely applied in standard NLP workflows.
        -  In this base line, it aims to present a work flow that can be ablied
           to
        
           -  different languages
           -  differrent problem domains
           -  analysis on a single theme with limited training set
        
        1. Overall work flow
        --------------------
        
        In short, the workflow presented on this notebook is the second stage on
        a workflow objective of which is being able to measure relevance of a
        given external input to a specific theme, issue or topic. The steps of
        the work flow is as follows.
        
        1. Forming a specific corpus where the corpus consists of set of
           documents around a topic. The corpus could be
        
           -  a set of blog articles around an issue let say green finance
           -  or a set of Wikipedia articles around the same subject
           -  or collection of news articles around the green finance
           -  or collection of tweets around the same issue.
        
           At the moment we have another module that given a set of seed
           Wikipedia articles around an issue the crawler scrapes textual data
           from articles. For the details of the module please `see the scraper
           module. <https://github.com/bulentozel/OpenMaker/tree/master/Scraping>`__.
           The output of that module is a set of input texts stored in a
           collection in JSON format.
        
        2. Given an input set of texts on a theme a concept or a topic identify
           set of terms that more likely or less likely can occur within a
           discussion on the topic. This module hereby presents one of the
           simple methods for this purpose.
        
        3. Given a list of weighted terms which are more likely to occur or
           reprsent a theme, concept or topic and input query text measure the
           relevance of the input text to the topic/theme/concept. `The notebook
           in this
           link <https://github.com/bulentozel/OpenMaker/blob/master/Semantics/Score%20Text.ipynb>`__
           demonstrates one way doing such scoring of a given text against the
           curated set of terms of this particular module.
        
        2. Suggested future work
        ------------------------
        
        -  Comparing and combining this comparison based scoring with matrix
           decompostion based topic modelling approaches such as NMF, LDA, LSI.
        
        -  Using language specicif term frequency counts of Wikipedia itself for
           comparisons. In NLP terminology, the *foreground* corpus around a
           topic needs to be compared and contrasted to a *background* corpus.
        
        -  Improving the semantic crawler of the previous stage to be able to
           increase quality of the specific corpuses
        
        Methodological Improvements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Instead of tokenizing all terms, examine possibilities of key-phrase
           extrcation combining with *tf-idf* and
        
           -  experiment with extracting noun phrases and words, for this use
              NLTK's regular expression module for POS (part of speeach)
              analysis.
           -  extract n-grams where n=1,2,3
        
        3. Definitions and assumptions
        ------------------------------
        
        Assumptions
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  At the comparison stage, it is assumed that a document's terms tend
           to be relatively frequent within the document as compared to an
           external reference corpus. However, it should be noted this
           assumption is contested in the field. See the paper by Chuang et el.
        
        -  Condidering the fact that the crawler is used to aggregate
           semantically related set of documents into a single document, *tf x
           idf* is equivalent to *tf*. As can be seen below, we use a normalized
           version of *tf*: *ntS / NS*.
        
        -  Fewer number of but relatively more relevant training (input corpus)
           is prefered in order to reduce term extraction problems due to length
           of documents. However, it should be noted that the crawling depth of
           an identiefied wiki article from stage 1 of this document can be used
           as an additional weight on relevance/reprsesntation of keywords.
        
        -  We have limited ourselves to terms instead of n-grams and phrases or
           use of POS to be able to develop a base model that can work on
           different languages.
        
        Term
        ~~~~
        
        Given for instance a set of texts around open source software movement a
        term that is identified can be a word such as *openness*, a person such
        as *Stallman* a license type such as *GNU*, an acronym for an
        organization such as *FSF* the Free Software Foundation, or a technology
        such as *Emacs*.
        
        Likelihood ratio
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        It is a simple measure computed comparing frequency count of a term in a
        specific corpus versus its frequency count in the reference reference
        corpus. Here assumption is that the reference corpus is a large enough
        sample of the language at observing the occurance of a term. Then having
        a higher/lower observation frequency of a term in the specific corpus is
        a proxy indicator for the term choice while having a debate on the
        topic.
        
        The likelihood ratio for a term :math:`P_t` is calculated as:
        
        :math:`P_t = log ( (ntS/NS) / (ntR/NR) )`
        
        where
        
        -  *ntS* is the raw frequency count of the term in the entire specific
           corpus
        -  *ntR* is the raw frequenccy count of the term in the reference corpus
        -  *NS* is the total number of terms in the specific corpus
        -  *NR* is the total number of terms in the reference corpus
        
        It should be noted that frequency counts are calculated after having
        applied the same tokenization and post processing such as excluding
        stop-words, pancuations, rare terms, etc both on the reference corpus
        and the specific corpus.
        
        4. Some thoughts on a conceptual approach at using the extracted keywords or phrases to predict topical relevance of a new text
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Using the outcome of this technique to score arbitrary input texts
        against a single issue such as financial sustainability or against a set
        of issues such as the 10 basic human values requires a set of
        normalization of the raw scores and their rescaling/transformation.
        
        The factors that need to be considered are:
        
        -  **Differing document lengths:** The likelihood of repetion of a key
           phrase increases as the size of the input text gets larger. In more
           concrete terms, when a scoring that simply sums up detection of
           weighted keyphrases or words within a given input text would be very
           sensitive to the document length. For isntance, the an executive
           summary of an article would very likely get quite lower score than
           the full article on any issue.
        
           *Among other methods, this can simply be resolved by computing per
           word scores, where the word set to be conidered is the tokenized and
           cleaned set of words that represent the input text.*
        
        -  **Topical relevance:** This factor would be important when the
           subject matter of the inputs texts vary among each other. In other
           words, this factor would matter to a very high significance, let's
           say when one wants to compare perceptions of indivuduals on the role
           of privacy in democracies and when this question is not asked them in
           a uniform manner, that is under the same social, cultural,
           environmental and physical conditions.
        
           Let’s assume that issue under investigation is again pricacy in
           democracies. It is possible that the same individual as a blogger who
           has a strong pro-privacy opinion (i) may not touch the issue while
           talking on data science, (ii) he would slightly touch the issue while
           he talks about her preferences in mobile devices (iii) He dives into
           subject using all keywords and phrases when he talks about impact of
           privacy in a democratic life. In brief, it is necessary to offset the
           variability of the topical relavance of an input text to the issue
           under investigation when arbitrary text samples are used for scoring.
        
           *An offsetting scheme can be devised when opinion or perception of an
           actor is to be measured with respect to more than one factor that
           define the issue under investigation. For instance, when we want to
           measure the position of a political leader on individual liberties vs
           social security or when we want to profile discourse of the political
           leader as of a number of basic human values we could employ some
           simple statistical methods in order to offset the topical relevance
           of the discourses or the speeches of the political figure to what we
           would like to measure.*
        
           *A simple method could be rescaling the scores on each sub factor
           such as the scores of liberty and security that are measured from the
           same speech into a range of -1 to 1. This can simply be done by
           taking the mean of the two and then deducting the mean from each
           score and scaling them into a scala of -1 to 1. This way it may be
           possible to use multiple speeches of the same political figure on
           different topics to evalaute his or her postion on liberty vs
           security matter.*
        
        In statistical terms this problem corresponds to adjusting or
        normalizing ratings or scores measured on different scales to a
        notionally common scale. Given the fact that in most cases a normal
        distribution for underlying factors may not be assumed the
        quantile-normalization technique is suggested. The quantile
        normalization sorts and ranks the variables with a non-negative
        amplitudes. Then these rankings can be scaled to for instance to a 0-1
        interval.
        
        -  **Level of subjectivity**. This is variability in terms of relevant
           importance attributed to each issue out of a given set of issues. For
           instance, it is possible that a great many individuals or political
           leaders would attach a higher importance to individual liberties than
           secuirty or otherway around. But the question might be rather to
           understand to what extend one attaches more importance to an issue
           more than the others. So when the objective of the scoring is not
           simply to make an order of importance, then a comparative importance
           with respect to overall observations needs to be tackled.
        
           *Observed variances in each query texts can be considered. That is, a
           simple statistical methods can be used for instance to be able to
           compare two or more query texts with respect to each other. A
           suggested method would be (1) estimate coefficient of variation for
           each input text using per-word scores (2) the rescale
           quantile-normalized scores that is suggested above using the
           estimated coefficient of variation in each case.*
        
           *When this rescaling is applied, for instance, liberty vs security
           the coeffcient of variation would act as a polarization measure.*
        
        Scoring a group of variables
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        When one attempts to use scores generated by this package, using
        specific vs reference corpus comparisons, on a group of variable then
        both ranking of the scores as well as the relevant importance of each
        score from a number of texts from the same source should be taken into
        consideration.
