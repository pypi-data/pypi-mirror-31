        ====================
        Disclaimer: I have no connection to `travis-ci`_ at all other than being a satisfied customer.  I wrote this utility to avoid having to install Ruby, dependencies etc in order to run the `travis-ci`_ command line tool which does far more than I actually needed.
        
        What It Does
        ------------
        This is a Python utility that parses your `travis-ci`_ configuration file and lints whether it is valid generic YAML before passing it to `travis-ci`_'s own linter.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        It is recommended that you install the utility into either `Virtualenv`_ or `Venv`_ environment after which the following should install this utility:
        ::
        
          $ pip install travislint
        
        
        The travislint application can then be run to lint your `travis-ci`_ configuration file.
        
        Usage
        -----
        ::
        
          travislint [-h] [-v] [filename]
        
          Lint a .travis.yml file
        
          positional arguments:
            filename       name of the file to lint (default: .travis.yml)
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help     show this help message and exit
            -v, --verbose  verbose output of progress
        
        
        Under the Covers
        ----------------
        It turns out that the `travis-ci`_ command line tool does not actually lint your file itself but hands off this task to a portion of the `travis-ci`_ website.  So it was simple to do this using the Python `requests`_ package and save you from having to install Ruby etc.
