django-admin-testutils
======================

django-admin-testutils contains helpers to make writing selenium unit tests
for the Django admin easier. It is based on the code that supported selenium
unit tests in `django-nested-admin`_.

The test runner is designed to work similarly to the Django frameworkâ€™s own
runtests.py. Until this project has had documentation written for it, the
best guide on usage can be found in the unit tests for this repository.
Specifically, look at `runtests.py`_ and `django_admin_testutils/tests/test.py`_.
