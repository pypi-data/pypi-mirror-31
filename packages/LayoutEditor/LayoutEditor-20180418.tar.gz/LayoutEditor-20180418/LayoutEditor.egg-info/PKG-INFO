        Chip-on-Board (COB), Low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC), Monolithic
        Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC), printed circuit boards (PCB), thick
        film technology, thin film technology, ....
        
        The LayoutEditor includes [LayoutScript][LayoutScript] a scription interface to several scripting languages.
