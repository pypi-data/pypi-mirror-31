        This is a web app designed to crunch data into charts, maybe like a
        dashboard.
        
        Release
        -------
        
        Version 1
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        For this version the goals were:
        
        -  Create an API in python that can be customized easily (finding an
           implenting a framework)
        -  Provide a flexible api that can render csv files into charts (only
           basic ones will work)
        
           -  Have the possibility to render more than one chart per page
           -  Have the possibility to color the charts automatically
        
        -  Provide an endpoint so that you can use http request to get the csv
           data into json
        -  Provide an html view of the csv data
        -  Have a start with SQL compatibilities
        -  Have all functionality developed using TDD (test driven development)
           as much as possible

        ------------------
        
        I want to display other alternatives because well, this is a bit missing
        in feature as of now, and you might want to know what is being developed
        and maintained.
        
        -  `plotly - Dash <https://github.com/plotly/dash>`__: flask framework
           using react and plotpy to display charts in a nice dashboard.
        -  `anaconda - Bokeh <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/>`__ depends on
           Jinja2 for templating, bokeh server and js library for chart
        -  `jwkvam - bowtie <https://github.com/jwkvam/bowtie>`__: sockets.io,
