class Tree:

    '''
    This class is a tree representation of a digital element, such as a
    gate, and its inputs. The class uses the backtrack() function which follows
    the element and tracks the inputs, and inputs of inputs, and so on, thus
    constructing the backtrack tree.

    The tree construction has the possibility to not follow cycles so the final
    output is simpler.

    The print_tree() function can be used to print the Tree in a readable way.
    The following examples show two use cases, one of which shows what happens
    if cycles are not being followed.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> g1 = AND(True, False)
    >>> g2 = AND(True, False)
    >>> g3 = AND(g1, g2)
    >>> tree = Tree(g3, 2)
    >>> tree.backtrack()
    >>> tree.print_tree()
    |- AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [0, 0];
       |- AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [True, False];
          |- True
          |- False
       |- AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [True, False];
          |- True
          |- False

    If the algorithm was executed to not follow cycles, the output will have
    marks indicating repetitions. In the following example the elements
    marked with [0] are the same and have no sons to avoid repetitive
    output. The same for the elements with [1].

    >>> c1 = Connector(True)
    >>> c2 = Connector(True)
    >>> g1 = AND(True, c1)
    >>> g2 = AND(c2, False)
    >>> g3 = AND(g1, g2)
    >>> g4 = AND(g3, True)
    >>> g3.set_output(c1)
    >>> g4.set_output(c2)
    |- [1] AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [0, True];
       |- [0] AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [0, 0];
          |- AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [True, 0];
             |- True
             |- Connector; State: 0
                |- [0] AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [0, 0];
          |- AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [0, False];
             |- Connector; State: 0
                |- [1] AND Gate; Output: 0; Inputs: [0, True];
             |- False
