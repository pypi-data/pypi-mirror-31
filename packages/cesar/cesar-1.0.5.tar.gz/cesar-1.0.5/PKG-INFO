        # cesar
        Cesar (de)ciphers a given text with Caesar Cipher.
        
        ## Calling cesar
        As a Python script, it can be called with:
        `python cesar.py [options]`
        
        Alternatively, it can be used as a system command:
        `./cesar.py [options]`
        
        One could copy the file to a location in $PATH and remove the extension.
        That way you could just call it from anywhere as:
        `cesar [options]`
        
        ## Usage
        Cesar is written so it behaves as any other GNU/Linux console command.
        
        Admits the input message in three different ways:
        - Direct input after calling the command (default).
        - Add input to the command (-m option).
        - Read input from file (-i option).
        
        The input can either be:
        - A plain message to cipher (default).
        - A ciphered message to decipher (-d option).
        
        The ouput will be either:
        - Shown in the console (default).
        - Written to a file (-o option, overwrites, add -a to append).
        
        Help can be seen using -h, --help option.
        
        Version can be seen using --version option.
        
        ## Notes
        Due to the cyclical nature of this cipher, there is no actual difference between
        encryption and decryption but the key used.
        
        For example, a shift of 3 to the left is equivalent to a shift of 23 to the right.
        
        ## Warning
        This cipher is not secure AT ALL. It is provided for its historical significance (and also for fun!).
        
        DO NOT USE IT TO CIPHER ANY INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN SECURE.
