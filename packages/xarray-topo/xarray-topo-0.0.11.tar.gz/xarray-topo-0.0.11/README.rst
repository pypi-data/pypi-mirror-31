xarray-topo: xarray extension for topographic analysis and modelling
====================================================================

|Doc Status|

xarray-topo is a Python package that extends xarray_ with a small set of
topographic tools useful for processing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and/or
outputs of Landscape Evolution Models (LEMs).

It also provides `xarray-simlab`_ compatible models and re-usable model
components (i.e., processes) for landscape evolution modelling.

**Warning: this package is currently under heavy development (no stable release yet).**
