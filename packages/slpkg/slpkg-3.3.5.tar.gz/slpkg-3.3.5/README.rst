* Choose default repositories you need to work from the file '/etc/slpkg/repositories.conf' 
  defaults are 'slack' and 'sbo' repositories and please read the REPOSITORIES file for each 
  of the particularities.
  If a repository is not in the above list, manage the custom repositories with the commands 
  'repo-add' and 'repo-remove'.


Usage
-----

First need to run '# slpkg update' to synchronize the list of packages, also every time you add
a new repository.
To add or remove repositories must edit the file '/etc/slpkg/repositories.conf' or
run '# slpkg repo-enable' (python2-pythondialog required).

Add custom repositories with the command '# slpkg add-repo <repository name> <URL>' and after
run '# slpkg update' to update package list.

View list of repositories with the command '# slpkg repo-list' or get repository information 
with the command '# slpkg repo-info <repository>.

Update slpkg itself simply run '# slpkg update slpkg', and slpkg check from GitHub repository if
new versions are available.

Checking packages health with the command "# slpkg health" and slpkg check if the files missing from the package file list.

Print the dependencies status used by packages with the command '# slpkg deps-status' or 
drawing image map dependencies with the additional option '--graph=[image]'.

Manage .new configuration files with the command 'slpkg new-config' like remove, overwrite, merge etc.

If you have already downloaded the script and the source code you can build the package with 
the command '# slpkg -a <sbo_script.tar.gz> <sources>'.

Manage the packages in the black list with the command '# slpkg -b <packages> --add or --remove'.

Add the SBo packages to queue with the command '# slpkg -q <packages> --add or --remove' and 
manage as build, install or build and install with the command '# slpkg build or install or 
build-install'.
This is very useful if you want to install multiple packages together suffice to add in the 
right order if there are dependent packages.

View list of the packages from specific repository with command '# slpkg -l <repository>'.
Combine with the command 'grep' to catch the results you want.

Check and upgrade your distribution or upgrade your packages with the command '# slpkg -c <repository> 
--upgrade'. Don't forget to update the packages list before (for 'slack' repository it's not necessary).
This command except upgrade the packages will fix the packages with the broken dependencies. 
Switch off the automatic resolve dependencies with the additional option '--resolve-off'. 
Use '--checklist' option to help you to choose easy the packages. For advanced users, the 
option '--skip' give them more power (see man page).

The most famous command is '# slpkg -s <repository> <packages>', this command downloads, build 
and installs packages with the resolve all the dependencies or switch off resolve with the 
additional option '--resolve-off'. 
Also the additional option "--case-ins" help you find the packages with case insensitive.
Two new arguments will help you to rebuild '--rebuild' or reinstall '--reinstall' packages.
The last one argument "--patches" help you to switch in the patches/ directory only for slack
repository.

Tracking the dependencies of a package with command '# slpkg -t <repository> <package>'.
Displays a package dependency tree and also shows to you which ones are installed on your 
system events.
Check if the packages used from other packages with the additional option '--check-deps' or 
drawing image map dependencies with the additional option '--graph=[image]'.

Get information description of a package with the command '# slpkg -p <repository> <package>' 
and change the color of text with the additional flag '--color=[]'.

View a SBo package page on your terminal with command '# slpkg -n <package>' and then manage 
multiple choices such read, download, build, install etc.

If you want to find the packages of all the repositories, that command will solve your hands '# slpkg -F <packages>'. It will search in all the enabled repositories will find the configuration file '/etc/slpkg/repositories.conf' will print all the packages that match the description that you enter.

If you want to see if any packages are installed on your system enter the command '# slpkg -f <packages>'. The surprise in the end is the reporting of the packages sum and size that found.

The next four commands '# slpkg --installpkg, --upgradepkg, --removepkg <packages>' install, upgrade, 
remove packages from your system events.
Notable mention must give the command '# slpkg --removepkg <packages>' which can remove the packages with all dependencies together after editing configuration file '/etc/slpkg/slpkg.conf' 
(default is disable) or add additional option "--deps". Also you can check if the packages used as dependency with additional the option "--check-deps". Option "--tag" allow to remove packages with by TAG.
Optional you can use the dialog utility with the additional option "--checklist" (require python2-pythondialog).

The last command is useful to print the entire contents of a package installed on the system with the command '# slpkg -d <packages>'.

Some examples you will see below.


Issues
------

Please report any bugs in `ISSUES <https://github.com/dslackw/slpkg/issues>`_


Testing
-------

The majority of trials have been made in an environment Slackware x86_64 'stable' 
and x86 'current' version 14.2.


Slackware Current
-----------------

For Slackware 'current' users must to change the variable VERSION in '/etc/slpkg/slpkg.conf' 
file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ slpkg -g edit


Slackware ARM
-------------

Must you use only two repositories currently there are 'slack' and 'sbo'.


Slackware Mirrors
-----------------

Slpkg uses the central mirror "http://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/" to find the 
nearest one. If however for some reason this troublesome please edit the file in 
'/etc/slpkg/slackware-mirrors'.

Slpkg Examples
--------------

Enable or disable default repositories, edit /etc/slpkg/repositories.conf file or with 
the command.
(require pythondialog, install with '# slpkg -s sbo python2-pythondialog'):

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ slpkg repo-enable

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dslackw/images/master/slpkg/repo_enable.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dslackw/images/master/slpkg/deps2.png


If you use slpkg for the first time will have to create and update the package 
list. This command must be executed to update the package lists:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ slpkg update

    Update repository [slack] ... Done
    Update repository [sbo] ... Done
    Update repository [alien] ... Done
    Update repository [slacky] ... Done
    Update repository [conrad] ... Done
    Update repository [slonly] ... Done
    Update repository [ktown] ... Done
    Update repository [salix] ... Done
    Update repository [slacke] ... Done
    Update repository [slackl] ... Done
    Update repository [multi] ... Done
    Update repository [msb] ... Done

    Update specifically repositories:

    $ slpkg update --only=sbo,msb,slacky

Also you can check ChangeLog.txt for changes like:

.. code-block::

    $ slpkg -c sbo

    Searching for symbolic links:

    No symbolic links were found, so we wont make an installation script.
    You can make your own later in ./install/doinst.sh and rebuild the
    package if you like.

    This next step is optional - you can set the directories in your package
    to some sane permissions. If any of the directories in your package have
    special permissions, then DO NOT reset them here!

    Would you like to reset all directory permissions to 755 (drwxr-xr-x) and
    directory ownerships to root.root ([y]es, [n]o)? n

Python modules
--------------
Slpkg has been designed it to work as cli tool however you can use some modules in your
own python code.

Get the package dependencies from the sbo repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> from slpkg.sbo.dependency import Requires
    >>> Requires(flag="").sbo("vlc")
    [['libass', 'libdc1394', 'libdvbpsi', 'libmpeg2', 'libupnp', 'lua', 'portaudio',
    'twolame', 'opus', 'ffmpeg', 'libwebp', 'gsm', 'opencv', 'libtar', 'libkate', '

    'libxkbcommon', 'libinput'], ['libwacom']]

Example from binary repository:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    >>> from slpkg.binary.dependency import Dependencies
    >>> Dependencies(repo="slonly", black="").binary(name"Flask", flag="")
    [['Jinja2', 'click', 'itsdangerous', 'werkzeug'], ['MarkupSafe']]

Grab packages from the sbo repository:

    >>> from slpkg.sbo.read import ReadSBo
    >>> url = sbo_search_pkg(name="libreoffice")
    >>> ReadSBo(url).readme("README")
    'LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major\noffice

    kage from the official binary (RPM\'s)\ndistributed by The Document Foundation.
