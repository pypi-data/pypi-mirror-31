Tide Gravity
============

tidegravity is a Python library which implements the Longman scheme for computing the tidal accelerations due to the
moon and sun, as published by I.M. Longman in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol 64, no. 12, 1959
This can be useful for correcting survey data collected with a relative gravity meter.

Requirements
------------

The numpy and pandas libraries are required for processing tide corrections, and importing trajectory data for correction

The matplotlib library is currently only used in the examples to give a visual representation of the data.

Examples
--------

There are several example scripts in the examples directory illustrating how to use the longmantide solving functions.

Here is a simple demonstration of calculating a correction series for a static latitude/longitude/altitude over a
specified time period, with intervals of 1 second.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from tidegravity import solve_point_corr

    # Example static data for Denver, January 1, 2018
    lat = 39.7392
    lon = -104.9903
    alt = 1609.3
    t0 = datetime(2018, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)

    # Calculate corrections for one day (60*60*24 points), with 1 second resolution
    result_df = solve_point_corr(lat, lon, alt, t0, n=60*60*24, increment='S')

    # Result is a pandas DataFrame, with a DatetimeIndex, and correction
    # values in the 'total_corr' column i.e.
    corrections = result_df['total_corr'].values

    # Plot the corrections using matplotlib
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    plt.plot(corrections)
    plt.ylabel('Tidal Correction [mGals]')
    plt.show()
