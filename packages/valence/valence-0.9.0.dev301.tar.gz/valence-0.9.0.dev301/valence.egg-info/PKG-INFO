        Overview
        ********
        
        Valence is a service for lifecycle management of pooled bare-metal hardware
        infrastructure.  The concept of pooled storage (SSDs or nvmE) disaggregated
        from compute nodes and network disaggregated from compute and storage
        provides the flexibility to compose and uses as and when the cloud requires
        more server resources. Valence provides the capability "compose" hardware nodes
        and release resources as needed by the overcloud.
        
        Valence supports Redfish as default management protocol to communicate
        to hardware. It supports Rack Scale Design (RSD), Open architecture for management
        of disaggregated server hardware resources, which is standardized in Redfish.
        Valence also provides capability to manage other vendors disaggregated hardware
        using their respective drivers other than Redfish.
