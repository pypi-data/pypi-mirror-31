# PyPROMS

PyPROMS is a library of Python classes that helps Python coders generate provenance reports using the PROV and PROMS OWL Ontologies. It also has a function to send a Report to an instances of the [PROMS Server](http://promsns.org/wiki/proms) for storage.

The Python classes match the PROMS-O OWL classes, for example the class 'Report' matches the PROMS-O 'Report' class.

PyProms is expected to be extended so if you need so add to it to get your reporting job done, please do so!
