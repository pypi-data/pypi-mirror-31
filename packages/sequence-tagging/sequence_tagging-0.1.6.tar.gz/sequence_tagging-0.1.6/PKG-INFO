        ##
        
        A Part of Speech tagger using the Average Perceptron.
        
        Based on the tagger from [here](https://explosion.ai/blog/part-of-speech-pos-tagger-in-python)
        
        This uses the following features:
        
         * The Suffix (last 3 characters) of the current word (unnormalized).
         * The Prefix (first character) of the current word (unnormalized).
         * The current word.
         * The previous Part of Speech tag and the current word.
         * The Previous Part of Speech tag.
         * The Part of Speech tag from the word before last.
         * Both of the previous Part of Speech tags.
         * The previous word.
         * The previous word suffix.
         * The word from 2 steps back.
         * The next word.

         * The word after next.
         * A Bias
        
        Includes the following Pretrained models.
        
          * POS Tagger, Trained on the CoNLL 2000 Chunking data
          * Chunker, Trained on the CoNLL 2000 Chunking data
          * Slot filler, Trained on ATIS data
