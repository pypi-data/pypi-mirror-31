Description: ipspan
        =======================
        
        ipspan is a basic library that supports converting between a list
        of IP addresses and several different forms of range notation.
        
        The primary audience is developers looking to concisely communicate lists
        of IP addresses.

        ----
        
        This project was based on the Python Sample Project distributed from
        `<https://packaging.python.org/>`_.
        
        This is the README file for the project.
        
        The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using `reStructuredText
        <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. It
        will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
        the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
        that purpose.
        
        Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
        usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
        a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
        may be appropriate.
