OneFL Deduper
------------

OneFlorda Entity Resolution Software (aka Deduper)
<https://github.com/ufbmi/onefl-deduper> is designed to generate hashes of the
specific patient data elements.

Multiple generated hashes are then matched against the registry of "known"
hashes and associated with a Unique Universal Identifier (aka OneFlorida UUID).

The UUID is used to de-duplicate medical records such as
demographics, procedures, diagnoses, vitals, lab results submitted
from different hospital networks.
