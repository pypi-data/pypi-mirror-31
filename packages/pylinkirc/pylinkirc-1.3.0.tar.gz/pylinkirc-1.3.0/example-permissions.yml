# This file is an example of the permissions system in PyLink. To fine-tune permissions, you should
# merge the "permissions:" block in this file with the one in your PyLink configuration, creating it
# if it doesn't already exist. Simply renaming this file to permissions.yml DOES NOT work!

# Permissions work by mapping hostmasks, accounts, and exttargets to lists of permissions, allowing
# you to fine tune which users have access to which commands.

# If you do not specify any permissions block in your configuration, PyLink will default to a
# permission set defined by plugins, which usually correspond to the list below, but can be
# changed on every release.

# This determines whether we should merge plugins' built-in default permissions with the ones specified
# in the following permissions: block. Disabling this allows you greater control over the permissions
# PyLink gives, but you should check this file on every major update to see if any new permissions
# were added for commands. Otherwise, commands that were available before may cease to function!
