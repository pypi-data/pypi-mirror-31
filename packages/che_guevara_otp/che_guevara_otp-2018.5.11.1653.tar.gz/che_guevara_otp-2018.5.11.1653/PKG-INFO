        This module generates one-time passcodes that are based either on a
        counter or time using a secret key that is assumed known by server and
        client.
        
        The counter-based passcodes are hash-based one-time passcodes (HOTP) and
        are defined in `RFC 4226 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226>`__. The
        time-based passcodes are time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP) and are
        defined in `RFC 6238 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238>`__. For HOTP,
        the pseudorandom function used is HMAC-SHA-1 and the associated counter
        should be incremented after each passcode generation. TOTP is HOTP with
        a specified time interval for validity. A common time interval is 30
        seconds.
        
        setup
        =====
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install che_guevara_otp
        
        To set up a launcher for the ``che_guevara_otp`` command, copy
        ``Che.svg`` to ``/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/`` and copy
        ``che_guevara_otp.desktop`` to ``/usr/share/applications/``, for
        example:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo cp /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/che_guevara_otp-2018.5.11.1653-py3.5.egg/che_guevara_otp/data/Che.svg /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/
        
            sudo cp /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/che_guevara_otp-2018.5.11.1653-py3.5.egg/che_guevara_otp/data/che_guevara_otp.desktop /usr/share/applications/
        
        module
        ======
        
        HOTP passcodes can be generated in a way like the following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> import che_guevara_otp
            >>> secret = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
            >>> for nonce in range(0, 3):
            ...     print(che_guevara_otp.HOTP(secret = secret, nonce = nonce))
            ... 
            561452
            686073
            840123
        
        TOTP passcodes can be generated in a way like the following, where the
        default time interval is 30 seconds:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> import che_guevara_otp
            >>> secret = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
            >>> print(che_guevara_otp.TOTP(secret = secret))

        The command ``che_guevara_otp`` displays time-based one-time passcodes
        at 30 second intervals based on secrets stored in a specified file
        ``~/.secrets``. The file is unencrypted plaintext so userspace
        encryption combined with other security is assumed. The contents of the
        secrets file should be of the following form:
        
        ::
        
            OmegaBay:         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
