jazkarta.abtesttile
===================

This Plone addon provides a new Tile type for Mosaic Layout views.
It is a variation on a RichText tile which provides two WYSIWYG HTML
fields. It will randomly show one of the two HTML fields based on a
weighted ratio, for the purpose of A/B testing parts of a page layout.

Features
--------

- Includes optional support for custom JS to run with each rendered
  HTML option.

- Includes optional support for adding a campaign query string variable
  to any links in the rendered HTML, indicating whether option A or B
  was the source for analytics tracking.

- Provides a custom permision to restrict adding and editing of A/B
  Test Tiles to more privileged users.
