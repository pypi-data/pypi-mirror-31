Description: # Easy TensorFlow Logging
        
        Are you prototyping something and want to be able to _magically_ graph some value
        without going through all the usual steps to set up TensorFlow logging properly?
        
        `easy_tf_log` is a simple module to do just that.
        
        ```
        from easy_tf_log import tflog
        ```
        
        then you can do
        
        ```
        for i in range(10):
            tflog('really_interesting_variable_name', i)
        ```
        
        and you'll find a directory `logs` that you can point TensorBoard to
        
        `$ tensorboard --logdir logs`
        
        to get

        Based on logging code from OpenAI's [baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines).
        
        ## Installation
        
        For TensorFlow without GPU support:
        
        `pip install git+https://github.com/mrahtz/easy-tf-log#egg=easy-tf-log[tf]`
        
        For TensorFlow *with* GPU support:
        
        `pip install git+https://github.com/mrahtz/easy-tf-log#egg=easy-tf-log[tf_gpu]`
        
        ## Usage
        
        On import, `easy_tf_log` sets up a logger saving to a directory `logs`. To
        change the directory it logs to, call `easy_tf_log.set_dir(log_dir)`.
        
        `tflog(key, value)`: log `value` with name `key`.
