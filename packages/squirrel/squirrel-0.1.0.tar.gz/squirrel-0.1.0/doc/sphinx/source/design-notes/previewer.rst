Design
======

The PDF previewer aims to show several thumbnails of a the first page of a list of PDF
documents. The thumbnails are placed on a multi-column layout.

Another type of previewer is to display the two first page of a document at once and navigate
through the list using a previous and next action.

Each thumbnail is located in the scene using its grid position. An R-Tree of the bounding boxes
could be used for this purpose. A selection mechanism can be implemented in the corner of the
thumbnail as in Dolphin.

* thumbnail cache
* OpenGL rendering using a texture
