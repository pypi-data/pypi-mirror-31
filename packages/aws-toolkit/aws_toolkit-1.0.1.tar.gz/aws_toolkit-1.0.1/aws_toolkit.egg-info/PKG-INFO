        This project this target to automate the AWS provisioning process for ec2 and route53
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        This code is tested with python 2.7, addtional modules (prettytable, boto3, paramiko) are required which will be installed automaticlly.
        
        Need to configure following at home directory.
        
        #### For Linux and Mac.
        ```

        [default]
        region=ap-southeast-1
        output=json
        ```
        #### credentials file details
        ```
        [account1]
        aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
        aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
        
        [account2]
        aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7TEST
        aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYTESTKEY
        ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        * I have tested working on Mac and Linux
        
        * sudo pip install aws_toolkit==1.0.1
        
        ## How to use it
        
        ```
        from awspackage import aws
        
        myaws = aws.AWS("ROUTE53_Domain",
                	"VM Access KEY full path")
        
        myaws.main()
        
        ```
        * Could select the account to provision based on the section
        * AWS_ID refer to the AWS console ID
        * AWS_KEY refer to the aws console secrect key
        * ROUTE53_Domain refer to the domain name that registered to the AWS under the same account, eg. cjaiwenwen.com (Put dummy data if you dont have route53 service)
        * VM ACCESS KEY full path refer to the local pem key path eg, /Users/cjaiwenwen/Desktop/chenjun.pem 
        
        ## What can the library could achieve
        
        * Create instance on any region if the VPC has been already created
        * Control the number of the VMs could provisioned
        * Choose the AMI image
        * Choose the subnets
        * Choose the security group
        * Modify the security group rules if need to be
        * Choose the size of the VM
        * Assign CNAME for the provisioned VM
        * Continue ping the provisioned host
        * SSH to the host to confirm accessible (need to add ssh incoming rule)
