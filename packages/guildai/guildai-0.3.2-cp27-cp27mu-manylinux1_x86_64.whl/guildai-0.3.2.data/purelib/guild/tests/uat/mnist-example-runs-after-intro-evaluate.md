# MNIST example runs after intro evaluate

After running `evaluate` on `mnist-intro` we get a second run.

    >>> cd("examples/mnist2")
    >>> run("guild runs")
    Limiting runs to the current directory (use --all to include all)
    [0:...]  ./mnist-intro:evaluate  ... ...  completed
    [1:...]  ./mnist-intro:train     ... ...  completed
    <exit 0>
