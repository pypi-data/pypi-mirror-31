# SunPy Sphinx Theme

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sunpy/sunpy-sphinx-theme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sunpy/sunpy-sphinx-theme)

This repository contains the still work in progress sphinx theme for the new website and documentation.

To use put this in your `conf.py` file:

    from sunpy_sphinx_theme.conf import *

We have live version of our documentation that uses SunPy Website source branch and the master version of the theme, [here](http://sunpy.org/sunpy-sphinx-theme).
