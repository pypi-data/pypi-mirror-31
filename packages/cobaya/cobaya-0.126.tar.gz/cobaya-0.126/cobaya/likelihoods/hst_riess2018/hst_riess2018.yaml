likelihood:
  hst_riess2018:
    H0: 73.45
    H0_err: 1.66
    # Effective redshift of the measurement
    zeff: 0
    # If zeff != 0, angconversion converts inverse of the angular
    # diameter distance at z = zeff to H0 or the fiducial cosmology
    # (omega_k = 0, omega_lambda = 0.7, w = -1).
    # Likelihood is in terms of inverse of the angular
    # diameter distance, so includes the tiny cosmological
    # dependence of the measurement (primarily on w) correctly.
    # Obviously, it's not used if zeff = 0
    angconversion: 11425.8  # for zeff = 0.04, ignored for zeff = 0
