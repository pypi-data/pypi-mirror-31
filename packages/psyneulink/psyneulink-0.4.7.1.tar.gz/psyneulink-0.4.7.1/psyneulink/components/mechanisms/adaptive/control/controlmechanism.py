"""
Overview
--------

A ControlMechanism is an `AdaptiveMechanism <AdaptiveMechanism>` that modifies the parameter(s) of one or more
`Components <Component>`, in response to an evaluative signal received from an `ObjectiveMechanism`.  The
ObjectiveMechanism monitors a specified set of OutputStates, and from these generates the evaluative signal that is
used by the ControlMechanism's `function <ControlMechanism.function>` to calculate an `allocation_policy
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`: a list of `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` values for each of its
`ControlSignals <ControlSignal>`.  Each ControlSignal uses its `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` to calculate its
`intensity`, which is then conveyed by the ControlSignal's `ControlProjection(s) <ControlProjection>` to the
`ParameterState(s) <ParameterState>` to which they project.  Each ParameterState then uses the value received by a
ControlProjection to modify the value of the parameter for which it is responsible (see `ModulatorySignal_Modulation`
for a more detailed description of how modulation operates).  A ControlMechanism can regulate only the parameters of
Components in the `System` to which it belongs. The OutputStates used to determine the ControlMechanism's
`allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`, the `ObjectiveMechanism` used to evalute these, and the
parameters controlled by the ControlMechanism can be listed using its `show <ControlMechanism.show>` method.

    and has a `ControlSignal` for each parameter of the Components in the `system <EVCControlMechanism.system>` that it
    controls.  Each ControlSignal is associated with a `ControlProjection` that regulates the value of the parameter it
    controls, with the magnitude of that regulation determined by the ControlSignal's `intensity`.  A particular
    combination of ControlSignal `intensity` values is called an `allocation_policy`. When a `System` is executed that
    uses an EVCControlMechanism as its `controller <System.controller>`, it concludes by executing the EVCControlMechanism, which
    determines its `allocation_policy` for the next `TRIAL`.  That, in turn, determines the `intensity` for each of the
    ControlSignals, and therefore the values of the parameters they control on the next `TRIAL`. The OutputStates used
    to determine an EVCControlMechanism's `allocation_policy <EVCControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` and the parameters it
    controls can be listed using its `show <EVCControlMechanism.show>` method.

.. _ControlMechanism_System_Controller:

ControlMechanisms and a System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ControlMechanism can be assigned to and executed within one or more Systems (listed in its `systems
<Mechanism_Base.systems>` attribute), just like any other Mechanism.  It also be assigned as the `controller
<System.controller>` of a `System`, that has a special relation to the System: it is used to control any and all
parameters that have been `specified for control <ControlMechanism_Control_Signals>` in that System.  A
ControlMechanism can be the `controller <System.controller>` for only one System, and a System can have only one
one `controller <System.controller>`.  The System's `controller <System.controller>` is executed after all
of the other Components in the System have been executed, including any other ControlMechanisms that belong to it (see
`System Execution <System_Execution>`).  A ControlMechanism can be assigned as the `controller <System.controller>`
for a System by specifying it in the **controller** argument of the System's constructor, or by specifying the System
as the **system** argument of either the ControlMechanism's constructor or its `assign_as_controller
<ControlMechanism.assign_as_controller>` method. A System's `controller  <System.controller>` and its
associated Components can be displayed using the System's `show_graph <System.show_graph>` method with its
**show_control** argument assigned as `True`.


.. _ControlMechanism_Creation:

Creating a ControlMechanism
---------------------------

A ControlMechanism can be created using the standard Python method of calling the constructor for the desired type.
A ControlMechanism is also created automatically whenever a `System is created <System_Creation>`, and the
ControlMechanism class or one of its subtypes is specified in the **controller** argument of the System's constructor
(see `System_Creation`).  If the ControlMechanism is created explicitly (using its constructor), the
`ObjectiveMechanism` it uses to monitor and evaluate `OutputStates <OutputState>` is specified in the
**objective_mechanism** argument of its constructor, and the parameters it controls are specified in the
**control_signals** argument.  If the ControlMechanism is created automatically by a System, then the specification of
OutputStates to be monitored and parameters to be controlled are made on the System and/or the Components themselves
(see `System_Control_Specification`).  In either case the Components needed to monitor the specified OutputStates (an
`ObjectiveMechanism` and `Projections <Projection>` to it) and to control the specified parameters (`ControlSignals
<ControlSignal>` and corresponding `ControlProjections <ControlProjection>`) are created automatically, as described
below.

.. _ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism:

ObjectiveMechanism and Monitored OutputStates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a ControlMechanism is created, it is associated with an `ObjectiveMechanism` that is used to monitor and
evaluate a set of `OutputStates <OutputState>` upon which it bases it `allocation_policy
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`.  If the ControlMechanism is created explicitly, its ObjectiveMechanism
can be specified in the **objective_mechanism** argument of its constructor, using either of the following:

  * an existing `ObjectiveMechanism`, or a constructor for one;  in this case the **monitored_output_states** argument
    of the ObjectiveMechanism's constructor is used to specify the OutputStates to be `monitored and evaluated
    <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States>` (see `ControlMechanism_Examples`); note that, in this case, the
    default values for the attributes of the ObjectiveMechanism override any that ControlMechanism uses for its
    default `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`, including those of its `function
    <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` (see `note <EVCControlMechanism_Objective_Mechanism_Function_Note>` in EVCControlMechanism for
    an example);
  ..
  * a list of `OutputState specifications <ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States>`;  in this case, a default
    ObjectiveMechanism is created, using the list of OutputState specifications as the **monitored_output_states**
    argument of the ObjectiveMechanism's constructor.

If the **objective_mechanism** argument is not specified, a default ObjectiveMechanism is created that is not assigned
any OutputStates to monitor; this must then be done explicitly after the ControlMechanism is created.

When a ControlMechanism is created automatically as part of a `System <System_Creation>`:

  * a default ObjectiveMechanism is created for the ControlMechanism, using the list of `OutputStates <OutputState>`
    specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument of the System's contructor, and any others within the System that
    have been specified to be monitored (using the MONITOR_FOR_CONTROL keyword), as the **monitored_output_states**
    argument for the ObjectiveMechanism's constructor (see `System_Control_Specification`).

In all cases, the ObjectiveMechanism is assigned to the ControlMechanism's `objective_mechanism
<ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` attribute, and a `MappingProjection` is created that projects from the
ObjectiveMechanism's *OUTCOME* `OutputState <ObjectiveMechanism_Output>` to the ControlMechanism's `primary
InputState <InputState_Primary>`.

OutputStates to be monitored can be added to an existing ControlMechanism by using the `add_monitored_output_states
<ObjectiveMechanism.add_monitored_output_states>` method of the ControlMechanism's `objective_mechanism
<ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`.

.. _ControlMechanism_Control_Signals:

Specifying Parameters to Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ControlMechanism is used to control the parameter values of other `Components <Component>`.  A `ControlSignal` is
assigned for each parameter controlled by a ControlMechanism, and a `ControlProjection` is assigned from each
ControlSignal to the `ParameterState` for the corresponding parameter to be controlled.

The parameters to be controlled by a ControlMechanism can be specified where it is created.

If it is created explicitly, the parameters to be  controlled can be specified in the **control_signals** argument of
its constructor.  The argument must be a `specification for one more ControlSignals <ControlSignal_Specification>`.

If the ControlMechanism is created as part of a `System`, the parameters to be controlled by it can be specified in
one of two ways:

  * in the **control_signals** argument of the System's constructor, using one or more `ControlSignal specifications
    <ControlSignal_Specification>`;

  * where the `parameter is specified <ParameterState_Specification>`, by including a `ControlProjection` or
    `ControlSignal` in a `tuple specification <ParameterState_Tuple_Specification>` for the parameter.

When a ControlMechanism is created as part of a System, a `ControlSignal` is created and assigned to the
ControlMechanism for every parameter of any `Component <Component>` in the System that has been specified for control
using either of the methods above.

Parameters to be controlled can be added to an existing ControlMechanism by using its `assign_params` method to
add a `ControlSignal` for each additional parameter.

All of the ControlSignals for a ControlMechanism are listed in its `control_signals
<ControlMechanism.control_signals>` attribute, and all of its ControlProjections are listed in its
`control_projections <ControlMechanism.control_projections>` attribute.

.. _ControlMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _ControlMechanism_Input:

Input
~~~~~

A ControlMechanism has a single *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputState`, the `value <InputState.value>` of which is used as the
input to the ControlMechanism's `function <ControlMechanism.function>`, that determines the ControlMechanism's
`allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`. The *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputState receives its input
via a `MappingProjection` from the *OUTCOME* `OutputState <ObjectiveMechanism_Output>` of an `ObjectiveMechanism`.
The Objective Mechanism is specified in the **objective_mechanism** argument of its constructor, and listed in its
`objective_mechanism <EVCControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` attribute.  The OutputStates monitored by the
ObjectiveMechanism (listed in its `monitored_output_states <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states>`
attribute) are also listed in the `monitored_output_states <ControlMechanism.monitored_output_states>`
of the ControlMechanism (see `ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism` for how the ObjectiveMechanism and the
OutputStates it monitors are specified).  The OutputStates monitored by the ControlMechanism's `objective_mechanism
<ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` can be displayed using its `show <ControlMechanism.show>` method.
The ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism>` evaluates the specified OutputStates, and the result is
conveyed as the input to the ControlMechanism.


.. _ControlMechanism_Function:

Function
~~~~~~~~

A ControlMechanism's `function <ControlMechanism.function>` uses the `value <InputState.value>` of its
*ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputState` to generate an `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`.  By
default, each item of the `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` is assigned as the
`allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` of the corresponding `ControlSignal` in `control_signals
<ControlMechanism.control_signals>`;  however, subtypes of ControlMechanism may assign values differently
(for example, an `LCControlMechanism` assigns a single value to all of its ControlSignals).


.. _ControlMechanism_Output:

Output
~~~~~~

A ControlMechanism has a `ControlSignal` for each parameter specified in its `control_signals
<ControlMechanism.control_signals>` attribute, that sends a `ControlProjection` to the `ParameterState` for the
corresponding parameter. ControlSignals are a type of `OutputState`, and so they are also listed in the
ControlMechanism's `output_states <ControlMechanism.output_states>` attribute. The parameters modulated by a
ControlMechanism's ControlSignals can be displayed using its `show <ControlMechanism.show>` method. By default,
each value of each `ControlSignal` is assigned the value of the corresponding item from the ControlMechanism's
`allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`;  however, subtypes of ControlMechanism may assign values
differently.  The `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` is used by each ControlSignal to determine
its `intensity <ControlSignal.intensity>`, which is then assigned as the `value <ControlProjection.value>` of the
ControlSignal's `ControlProjection`.   The `value <ControlProjection.value>` of the ControlProjection is used by the
`ParameterState` to which it projects to modify the value of the parameter it controls (see
`ControlSignal_Modulation` for description of how a ControlSignal modulates the value of a parameter).


.. _ControlMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlMechanism that is a System's `controller` is always the last `Mechanism <Mechanism>` to be executed in a
`TRIAL` for that System (see `System Control <System_Execution_Control>` and `Execution <System_Execution>`).  The
ControlMechanism's `function <ControlMechanism.function>` takes as its input the `value <InputState.value>` of
its *ERROR_SIGNAL* `input_state <Mechanism_Base.input_state>`, and uses that to determine its `allocation_policy
<ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>` which specifies the value assigned to the `allocation
<ControlSignal.allocation>` of each of its `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>`.  Each ControlSignal uses that value to
calculate its `intensity <ControlSignal.intensity>`, which is used by its `ControlProjection(s) <ControlProjection>`
to modulate the value of the ParameterState(s) for the parameter(s) it controls, which are then used in the
subsequent `TRIAL` of execution.

.. note::
   A `ParameterState` that receives a `ControlProjection` does not update its value until its owner Mechanism
   executes (see `Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).  This means that even if a
   ControlMechanism has executed, a parameter that it controls will not assume its new value until the Mechanism
   to which it belongs has executed.


.. _ControlMechanism_Examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a ControlMechanism by specifying its **objective_mechanism** using a constructor
that specifies the OutputStates to be monitored by its `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`::

    >>> import psyneulink as pnl
    >>> my_transfer_mech_A = pnl.TransferMechanism(name="Transfer Mech A")
    >>> my_DDM = pnl.DDM(name="My DDM")
    >>> my_transfer_mech_B = pnl.TransferMechanism(function=pnl.Logistic,
    ...                                            name="Transfer Mech B")

    >>> my_control_mech = pnl.ControlMechanism(
    ...                          objective_mechanism=pnl.ObjectiveMechanism(monitored_output_states=[(my_transfer_mech_A, 2, 1),
    ...                                                                                               my_DDM.output_states[pnl.RESPONSE_TIME]],
    ...                                                                     name="Objective Mechanism"),
    ...                          function=pnl.LinearCombination(operation=pnl.PRODUCT),
    ...                          control_signals=[(pnl.THRESHOLD, my_DDM),
    ...                                           (pnl.GAIN, my_transfer_mech_B)],
    ...                          name="My Control Mech")


This creates an ObjectiveMechanism for the ControlMechanism that monitors the `primary OutputState
<OutputState_Primary>` of ``my_Transfer_mech_A`` and the *RESPONSE_TIME* OutputState of ``my_DDM``;  its function
first multiplies the former by 2 before, then takes product of their values and passes the result as the input to the
ControlMechanism.  The ControlMechanism's `function <ControlMechanism.function>` uses this value to determine
the allocation for its ControlSignals, that control the value of the `threshold <DDM.threshold>` parameter of
``my_DDM`` and the  `gain <Logistic.gain>` parameter of the `Logistic` Function for ``my_transfer_mech_B``.

The following example specifies the same set of OutputStates for the ObjectiveMechanism, by assigning them directly
to the **objective_mechanism** argument::

    >>> my_control_mech = pnl.ControlMechanism(
    ...                             objective_mechanism=[(my_transfer_mech_A, 2, 1),
    ...                                                  my_DDM.output_states[pnl.RESPONSE_TIME]],
    ...                             control_signals=[(pnl.THRESHOLD, my_DDM),
    ...                                              (pnl.GAIN, my_transfer_mech_B)])
    ...

Note that, while this form is more succinct, it precludes specifying the ObjectiveMechanism's function.  Therefore,
the values of the monitored OutputStates will be added (the default) rather than multiplied.

The ObjectiveMechanism can also be created on its own, and then referenced in the constructor for the ControlMechanism::

    >>> my_obj_mech = pnl.ObjectiveMechanism(monitored_output_states=[(my_transfer_mech_A, 2, 1),
    ...                                                               my_DDM.output_states[pnl.RESPONSE_TIME]],
    ...                                      function=pnl.LinearCombination(operation=pnl.PRODUCT))

    >>> my_control_mech = pnl.ControlMechanism(
    ...                        objective_mechanism=my_obj_mech,
    ...                        control_signals=[(pnl.THRESHOLD, my_DDM),
    ...                                         (pnl.GAIN, my_transfer_mech_B)])

Here, as in the first example, the constructor for the ObjectiveMechanism can be used to specify its function, as well
as the OutputState that it monitors.

See `System_Control_Examples` for examples of how a ControlMechanism, the OutputStates its
`objective_mechanism <ControlSignal.objective_mechanism>`, and its `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>`
can be specified for a System.

        specifies the name of the ControlMechanism.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : default Mechanism.classPreferences
        specifies the `PreferenceSet` for the ControlMechanism; see `prefs <ControlMechanism.prefs>` for details.

    Attributes
    ----------

    system : System_Base
        The `System` for which the ControlMechanism is a `controller <System>`.  Note that this is distinct from
        a Mechanism's `systems <Mechanism_Base.systems>` attribute, which lists all of the Systems to which a
        `Mechanism` belongs -- a ControlMechanism can belong to but not be the `controller of a System
        <ControlMechanism_System_Controller>`.

    objective_mechanism : ObjectiveMechanism
        `ObjectiveMechanism` that monitors and evaluates the values specified in the ControlMechanism's
        **objective_mechanism** argument, and transmits the result to the ControlMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL*
        `input_state <Mechanism_Base.input_state>`.

    monitored_output_states : List[OutputState]
        each item is an `OutputState` monitored by the ObjectiveMechanism listed in the ControlMechanism's
        `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` attribute;  it is the same as that
        ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_output_states <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states>` attribute
        (see `ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Output_States` for specification).  The `value <OutputState.value>`
        of the OutputStates listed are used by the ObjectiveMechanism to generate the ControlMechanism's `input
        <ControlMechanism_Input>`.

    monitored_output_states_weights_and_exponents : List[Tuple(float, float)]
        each tuple in the list contains the weight and exponent associated with a corresponding item of
        `monitored_output_states <ControlMechanism.monitored_output_states>`;  these are the same as those in
        the `monitored_output_states_weights_and_exponents
        <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_states_weights_and_exponents>` attribute of the `objective_mechanism
        <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`, and are used by the ObjectiveMechanism's `function
        <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` to parametrize the contribution made to its output by each of the values that
        it monitors (see `ObjectiveMechanism Function <ObjectiveMechanism_Function>`).

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        determines how the `value <OuputState.value>` \\s of the `OutputStates <OutputState>` specified in the
        **monitor_for_control** argument of the ControlMechanism's constructor are used to generate its
        `allocation_policy <ControlMechanism.allocation_policy>`.

    allocation_policy : 2d np.array
        each item is the value assigned as the `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` for the corresponding
        ControlSignal listed in the `control_signals` attribute;  the allocation_policy is the same as the
        ControlMechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute).

    control_signals : ContentAddressableList[ControlSignal]
        list of the `ControlSignals <ControlSignals>` for the ControlMechanism, including any inherited from a
        `system <ControlMechanism.system>` for which it is a `controller <System.controller>` (same as
        ControlMechanism's `output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>` attribute); each sends a `ControlProjection`
        to the `ParameterState` for the parameter it controls

    control_projections : List[ControlProjection]
        list of `ControlProjections <ControlProjection>`, one for each `ControlSignal` in `control_signals`.

    modulation : ModulationParam
        the default form of modulation used by the ControlMechanism's `ControlSignals <GatingSignal>`,
        unless they are `individually specified <ControlSignal_Specification>`.

    name : str
        the name of the ControlMechanism; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a
        default is assigned by MechanismRegistry (see `Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the ControlMechanism; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the
        constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).
