Description: pylttb: downsampling using Largest Triangle Threebuckets algorithm
        ======================================================================================

        **pylttb** is an efficient implementation of Largest Triangle Threebuckets algorithm.
        
        The algorithm was described by Sveinn Steinarsson in his master thesis. More info and original
        implementation can be found at this `page <https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/flot-downsample/>`_. The code in **pylttb** is based on this implementation
        but structures computations a bit differently to leverage ``numpy`` 's array arithmetics.
        
        Usage example
        -------------
        Supposing you have arrays of ``x`` and ``y`` all you need to do to downsample them to given
        ``threshold`` is:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from pylttb import lttb
        
           down_x, down_y = lttb(x, y, threshold)
