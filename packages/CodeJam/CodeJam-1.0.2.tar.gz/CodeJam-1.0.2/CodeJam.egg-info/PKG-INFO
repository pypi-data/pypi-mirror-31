Description: This library has some utilities for concisely reading the input
        files in Google Code Jam.
        
        Also included is some maths and iterator utils which are often useful
        in writing solutions.
        
        The 'graphs' module is just a wrapper for the excellent NetworkX
        library with a couple of small additions.
