        Version: 0.9.3
        
        API library for Open Mining Format, a new standard for mining data backed by
        the `Global Mining Standards & Guidelines Group <http://www.globalminingstandards.org/>`_.
        
        .. warning::
            **Pre-Release Notice**
        
            This is a Beta release of the Open Mining Format (OMF) and the associated
            Python API. The storage format and libraries might be changed in
            backward-incompatible ways and are not subject to any SLA or deprecation
            policy.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        An open-source serialization format and API library to support data interchange
        across the entire mining community.
        
        Scope
        -----
        
        This library provides an abstracted object-based interface to the underlying
        OMF serialization format, which enables rapid development of the interface while
        allowing for future changes under the hood.
        
        Goals
        -----
        
        - The goal of Open Mining Format is to standardize data formats across the
          mining community and promote collaboration
        - The goal of the API library is to provide a well-documented, object-based
          interface for serializing OMF files
        
        Alternatives
        ------------
        
        OMF is intended to supplement the many alternative closed-source file formats
        used in the mining community.
        
        Connections
        -----------
        
        This library makes use of the `properties <https://github.com/seequent/properties>`_
        open-source project, which is designed and publicly supported by
        `Seequent <https://www.seequent.com>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install the repository, ensure that you have
        `pip installed <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ and run:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install omf
        
        Or from `github <https://github.com/GMSGDataExchange/omf>`_:
        
        .. code::
        
            git clone https://github.com/GMSGDataExchange/omf.git
            cd omf
            pip install -e .
