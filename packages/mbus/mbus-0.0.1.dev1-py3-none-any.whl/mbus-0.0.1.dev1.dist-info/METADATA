A Python library for M-Bus

This is an early python 2.7 implementation that we are planning on
open sourcing and convert to python 3. We didn't make the heaviest effort the
first time since the use case was very limited.

Now we plan on:

   * Making a better client implementation with cleaner API.
   * Adding support for communication over serial and transparent M-Bus over TCP.
   * More general M-Bus approach.
   * Smarter parsing of messages.
   * OBIS conversion
