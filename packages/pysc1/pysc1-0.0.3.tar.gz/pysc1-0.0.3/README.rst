pysc1 : The StarCraft I Learning Environment
============================================


This package is currently in enthusiastic development. Just wait a sec.
Meanwhile, refer to https://github.com/bboyseiok/pysc1-gym for now.

This project is also registered on pypi : https://pypi.org/project/pysc1/
I'll be waiting for the people who share the same interest and wants to build on the project!

Thank you.

Pysc1-gym
=========

Installing and managing Starcraft I learning environment can be tedious and full of errors. Here, I present to you packaged way of running a nice Starcraft I gym simulation in your laptop or some clusters.

I was using Windows 10 while making this work, so the instructions are made in reference to the Windows system. 

"OpenAI Gym" like code for Starcraft I
--------------------------------------

After the Environment is set, you can access the features of Starcraft I just like in OpenAI Gym:

.. code:: python

    env = sc.SingleBattleEnv(args.ip, args.port)
    env.seed(777)
    agent = RandomAgent(env.action_space)
    
    episodes = 0
    while episodes < 100:
        obs = env._reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = agent.act()
            obs, reward, done, info = env._step(action)
        episodes += 1
    
    env.close()


prerequisites
-------------

* OpenAI Gym
* Starcraft 1.1.16
* BWAPI 4.1.2
* TorchCraft 1.0.2
* TorchCraft-py
* Gym-TorchCraft

Because of the dependencies here, Python 2.7 is used. In the future, support for Python 3.6+ would be added.

* Python 2.7
I recommend using `conda create -n "pysc1-gym" python=2.7` to manage separate packages.

Get the TorchCraft 1.0-2 from [here](https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraft/releases)

check to prerequisites again. For start, `git clone https://github.com/openai/gym` and `cd gym` and `pip install -e .` for minimal install of gym.

Installation (Windows 10 with Anaconda)
---------------------------------------

The installation process is long, but it should be lot shorter than doing this from scratch. So relax and slowly follow the steps. Take a deep breath...

0) `activate pysc1-gym` to activate the environment.

1) Check your Starcraft Installation. The directory is called `$STARCRAFT`.

2) run `pysc1-gym/bwapi/BWAPI_412_Setup.exe` and install on `$BWAPI` directory and run `$BWAPI/Chaoslauncher/Chaoslauncher.exe` that is inside the BWAPI installation location.

3) From Settings in `Chaoslauncher`, choose the path to the Starcraft installation directory `$STARCRAFT`.

4) copy files in `pysc1-gym/torchcraft/*.dll` to `$STARCRAFT` directory.

5) copy files in `pysc1-gym/config/*.ini` to `$STARCRAFT/bwapi-data` directory

6) run `pysc1-gym/install.bat` (while still inside the `pysc1-gym` environment). This will install custom dependencies `torchcraft-py` and `gym-starcraft`. (Check if no existing installations are there in the pysc1-gym env.) This will take some time installing the dependencies. *wait patiently... have a coffee.*

7) copy contents of `pysc1-gym/maps/` to `$STARCRAFT/maps/`.

8) run Chaoslauncher with `BWAPI 4.1.2 injector [RELEASE]` and `W-mode 1.02` checked. The Starcraft window will open in waiting mode.

*Don't panic if the window is not responsive. It's supposed to be that way!*

9) cd `pysc1-gym/examples` (while still inside the `pysc1-gym` environment) and run `python random_agent.py --ip=localhost --port=11111`

10) The agent will run

Custom Maps for Reinforcement Learning
--------------------------------------

Custom maps I created for diverse RL environments.

BroodWar/Micros
---------------

* bc12v12_c_far.scx 12 Battlecruisers against each other

* m24v24_c_far_mod.scx 24 Marines against each other

* zt12v12_j_far.scm 11 Zealots and a High Templar against each other

TODO
----

* support python 3.6+
* more easy installation.
