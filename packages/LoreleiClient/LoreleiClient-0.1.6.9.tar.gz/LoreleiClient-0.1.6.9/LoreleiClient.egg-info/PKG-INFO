Description: Lorelei
        -------
        
        Lorelei is what I would call a "MUD++".
        
        This is a game client which connects to an authoratative game server to provide a visual representation of an entirely
        text based world. You control a hero with stats, and equipment in a big constantly updated world.
        
        This project was made using pygame as a user interface, and twisted as the networking library. Essentially this gave me
        the power to easily build a project structure from scratch that allows for easily serializing and deserializing objects
        over the network between the server and the client.
        
        The Server is closed source to prevent malicious attacks on the game. However the client and library source may be
        released at some point.

            a) Players can select race/class (DONE)
            b) Saves the created character and can load it back (DONE)

        5) Create more monsters / items
