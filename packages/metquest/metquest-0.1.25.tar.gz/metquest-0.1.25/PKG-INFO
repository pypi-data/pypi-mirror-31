Description: # MetQuest
        
        MetQuest is a dynamic programming based algorithm for identifying all possible
        pathways from metabolic networks between the source and the target metabolites. 
        MetQuest requires the genome-scale metabolic reconstructions,
        set of seed, source and target metabolites and the pathway length cut-off. 
        MetQuest is compatible with Python 3 and is OS-independent.  
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use pip3 to install metquest from 
        ```PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/metquest>```
        
        ```pip3 install metquest```
        
        ## Direct installation
        
        1. Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        2. Clone this repository to your computer using ```git``` or [download the repository](https://github.com/RamanLab/MetQuest) and decompress it.   
        3. Navigate to the folder where metquest is downloaded and type
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Required python packages
        
        1. cobra >= 0.11.3
        2. numpy >= 1.14.3
        3. scipy
        4. python-libsbml
        5. networkx >= 2.1
        
        ## Input
        
        Folder whose structure is as shown:
        ```
           â”œâ”€â”€ mainfolder              # Folder  
            â”œâ”€â”€ Example1               # Folder  
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€SBML model(s) of metabolic networks # XML files of the metabolic networks(COBRA-compatible)
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€seed_mets.txt       # Text file containing the seed metabolites separated by a newline
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€source_mets.txt     # Text file containing the source metabolites separated by a newline
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€target_mets.txt     # Text file containing the target metabolites separated by a newline
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€cutoff.txt          # Text file containing the size cut-offs separated by a newline
            â””â”€â”€ ...
         ```
        
        Kindly ensure that the SBML model has the field <model id> and the metabolites
        are prefixed with the model identifiers, for instance, if the model identifier is 
        'ecoli_core_model', and the seed metabolite is 'fum_c', the input text file
        should contain ecoli_core_model fum_c
        
        ## Running MetQuest
        
        #### From command line
        Navigae to the folder where metquest is installed and type
        ``` 
        python3 execute_metquest.py <path containing the input folder>
        
        ``` 
        
        
        
        #### From python console
        ```
        >>> import metquest
        >>> metquest.execute_all_codes()
        ```
        When prompted, enter the path containing the folder with all the data files
        
        #### Running examples
        
        In the python console, type the following
        
        ```
        >>> import metquest
        >>> metquest.example.run_this_example()
        ```
        
        This will run the example files.
