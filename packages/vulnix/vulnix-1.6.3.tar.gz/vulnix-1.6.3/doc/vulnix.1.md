# vulnix - Nix(OS) vulnerability scanner

## SYNOPSIS

`vulnix` [`OPTIONS`] _--system_

`vulnix` [`OPTIONS`] _PATH_ _..._

## DESCRIPTION

`vulnix` searches Nix derivations together with its transitive closure for
vulnerable software versions as published in the NIST NVD. Affected
derivations are reported together with matching CVE identifiers.

The last argument specifies where to start the search and can be either:

* A derivation file (e.g., _/nix/store/0123456789-program-1.0.drv_).
* A file in the Nix store for which a deriver is known.
* A link into the Nix store (e.g. _result_).

`vulnix` uses whitelists to mask certain combinations of packages and CVEs that
should not be reported. The NIST NVD is cached between `vulnix` invocations and
updated in regular intervals.

## OPTIONS

* `-S`, `--system`:
  Scans the current system defined as transitive closure of
  _/run/current-system_.

* `-G`, `--gc-roots`:
  Scans all active garbage collection roots. This option is of limited use since
  the scan will include all old system generations.

* `-w`, `--whitelist`=<FILE> | <URL>:
  Loads a whitelist from the specified local path or URL. See
  vulnix-whitelist(5) for an explanation of the whitelist syntax. It is not an
  error if the path/URL does not exist. This option can be given multiple times.

* `-W`, `--write-whitelist`=<FILE>:
  Writes a new copy of the whitelist which contains all reported vulnerable
  package versions in addition to existing whitelist entries (those loaded
  with `-w`). This option can be used to evolve whitelists so that every
  vulnerable version gets reported only once. Note that expired whitelist
  entries (e.g., those where the date set with the `until` option has passed)
  will not be written into the new whitelist.

* `-r`, `--requisites` / `-R`, `--no-requisites`:
  Determines if the transitive closure of the specified paths should be
  computed and scanned or only the given pathnames. Defaults to `--requisites`.

* `-c`, `--cache-dir`=<DIRECTORY>:
  Puts cached NVD entries into <DIRECTORY>. The directory will be created if it
  does not exist. Defaults to _~/.cache/vulnix_.

* `-m`, `--mirror`=<URL>:
  Fetches NIST NVD updates from <URL>. Defaults to
  _https://static.nvd.nist.gov/feeds/xml/cve/_.

* `-j`, `--json`:
  Outputs affected package versions as JSON document. The result is a list of
  dicts containing the following keys: name - package name and version; pname -
  package name without version; version - version only; affected_by - list of
  CVE identifiers; derivation - pathname of the scanned derivation file.

* `-s`, `--show-whitelisted`:
  Prints out whitelisted results in addition to regular (non-whitelisted)
  results. Note that this option is currently not compatible with `--json`.

* `-v`, `--verbose`:
  Prints additional pieces of information on _stderr_. This includes NVD
  updates, derivation paths and clickable links to CVE advisories. May be given
  twice for an extra level of debugging information.

* `-V`, `--version`:
  Prints program version and exits.

* `--help`:
  Prints options summary and exits.


## EXIT STATUS

Exit status are compatible with the [Nagios plugin development
guidelines](https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html) which means that it
can be directly used in the majority of monitoring systems.

`vulnix` exits 0zero if no vulnerabilities were found. If all
vulnerabilities were whitelisted, it exits 1. Otherwise, found
vulnerabilities lead to exit status 2. Exit status 3 indicates an error
condition.


## ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables affect `vulnix`:

* HOME:
  Determines the default cache directory.

* PATH:
  Used to invoke up low-level Nix utilities like `nix-store`.


## FILES ##

`vulnix` maintains a cache dir located at _~/.cache/vulnix_ by default.

The Nix store is assumed to be under _/nix/store_. This pathname is hardcoded.


## NOTES

`vulnix` auto-detects patches which contain one or more CVE identifiers in
derivation files and auto-whitelists the named vulnerabilities. See
vulnix-whitelist(5) for details.

Invoking `vulnix` with an empty cache directory can take quite a while since it
needs to download and process NIST NVD archives of the last 5 years. Once
initialized, only changed entries are fetched.

The cache directory grows slowly but steadily as there new CVE advisories added
on an ongoing basis.

`vulnix` is able to parse derivation files created by Nix up to version 2.0.


## EXAMPLES

Is my NixOS system vulnerable?

```
vulnix --system
```

Scan the output of nix-build(1) for dependencies with security advisories:

```
nix-build ... -o result
vulnix result
```

Report advisories for a derivation and its transitive closure as structured
JSON document:

```
vulnix -j /nix/store/cm0lrdrf6crb5v38iyygfsbzvivpmh6w-python3-3.6.4.drv
```

Report all advisories affecting the NixOS base install with whitelisting of
formerly known vulnerabilities and creation of an updated whitelist (a.k.a.
vulnerability roundup):

```
nix-build -I nixpkgs=. nixos/release-combined.nix
vulnix -j \
  -w https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ckauhaus/nixos-vulnerability-roundup/master/whitelists/master.toml \
  -W whitelist-master-new.toml \
  result
```
