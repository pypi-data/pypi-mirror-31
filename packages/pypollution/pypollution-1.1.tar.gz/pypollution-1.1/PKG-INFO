        -----------
        pollution is a python library for ploating real time COM port data. This library is project dependent library made for pollution detection and analysis. for more details http://https://github.com/Pamelabanerjee11/pollutionMonitor
        
        *This library is based on specified Hardware*
        
        Ex:
        ---
        
        import pypollution as plot
        import serial.tools.list_ports as ports
        import os
        
        print("Available ports : \nPort\t Hardwere")
        for i in range(len(ports.comports())):
        	print(ports.comports()[i])
        
        inputPort = input("\nEnter Ardiuno Port Number : ")
        try:
            p = plot.pyAnalysis(inputPort, os.path.dirname(__file__))
            p.genrateLineAnalysis()
        except:
            print("An error is occurred while plotting the graph. Probable reason may be :")
            print("1. You are running app in read only memory.")
            print("2. Check your hardware port(COM port).")
            print("3. Wrong port assignment.")
