Description: Just a bunch of pure-python functions for dealing with nested
        lists and dictionaries from a typical json file
        
        Also, this uses simplejson when available
        
        BIG CAVEATS:
        * Expects a top-level list
        * Does not allow lists nested directly in other lists
          (lists should only contain dictionaries or leaves)
        
        This may change with future developments :)
