.SS Description
.sp
An object you create when setting up an IPSec VPN between your on\-premises network and VCN. The \fICpe\fP is a virtual representation of your Customer\-Premises Equipment, which is the actual router on\-premises at your site at your end of the IPSec VPN connection. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the Networking Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the CPE to reside. Notice that the CPE doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the IPSec connection or other Networking Service components. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the CPE in the same compartment as the DRG. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must provide the public IP address of your on\-premises router. See \fI\%Configuring Your On\-Premises Router for an IPSec VPN\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/configuringCPE.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the CPE, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

.sp
In the request, you must include at least one static route to the CPE object (you\(aqre allowed a maximum of 10). For example: 10.0.8.0/16.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the IPSec connection to reside. Notice that the IPSec connection doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the DRG, CPE, or other Networking Service components. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the IPSec connection in the same compartment as the DRG. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the IPSec connection, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
After creating the IPSec connection, you need to configure your on\-premises router with tunnel\-specific information returned by \fI\%GetIPSecConnectionDeviceConfig\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnectionDeviceConfig/GetIPSecConnectionDeviceConfig\fP>\&. For each tunnel, that operation gives you the IP address of Oracle\(aqs VPN headend and the shared secret (that is, the pre\-shared key). For more information, see \fI\%Configuring Your On\-Premises Router for an IPSec VPN\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/configuringCPE.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To get the status of the tunnels (whether they\(aqre up or down), use \fI\%GetIPSecConnectionDeviceStatus\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnectionDeviceStatus/GetIPSecConnectionDeviceStatus\fP>\&.

.SS private\-ip
.SS Description
.sp
A \fIprivate IP\fP is a conceptual term that refers to a private IP address and related properties. The \fIprivateIp\fP object is the API representation of a private IP.
.sp
Each instance has a \fIprimary private IP\fP that is automatically created and assigned to the primary VNIC during instance launch. If you add a secondary VNIC to the instance, it also automatically gets a primary private IP. You can\(aqt remove a primary private IP from its VNIC. The primary private IP is automatically deleted when the VNIC is terminated.
.sp
You can add \fIsecondary private IPs\fP to a VNIC after it\(aqs created. For more information, see the \fIprivateIp\fP operations and also \fI\%IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP Only \fI\%ListPrivateIps\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/ListPrivateIps\fP> and \fI\%GetPrivateIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp\fP> work with \fIprimary\fP private IPs. To create and update primary private IPs, you instead work with instance and VNIC operations. For example, a primary private IP\(aqs properties come from the values you specify in \fI\%CreateVnicDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/CreateVnicDetails/\fP> when calling either \fI\%LaunchInstance\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Instance/LaunchInstance\fP> or \fI\%AttachVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/AttachVnic\fP>\&. To update the hostname for a primary private IP, you use \fI\%UpdateVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/UpdateVnic\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator.

.SS remote\-peering\-connection
.SS Description
.sp
A remote peering connection (RPC) is an object on a DRG that lets the VCN that is attached to the DRG peer with a VCN in a different region. \fIPeering\fP means that the two VCNs can communicate using private IP addresses, but without the traffic traversing the internet or routing through your on\-premises network. For more information, see \fI\%VCN Peering\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNpeering.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). For more information, see \fI\%VCNs and Subnets\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the VCN you must specify a single, contiguous IPv4 CIDR block. Oracle recommends using one of the private IP address ranges specified in \fI\%RFC 1918\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918\fP> (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16. The CIDR block can range from /16 to /30, and it must not overlap with your on\-premises network. You can\(aqt change the size of the VCN after creation.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the VCN to reside. Consult an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the subnets or other Networking Service components. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the VCN, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
You can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the instances to use the Interent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN. For more information, see \fI\%DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options. The OCID for each is returned in the response. You can\(aqt delete these default objects, but you can change their contents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on).
.sp
The VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an Internet Gateway or set up an IPSec VPN or FastConnect. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the Networking Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.

Not required to be unique, but it\(aqs a best practice to set unique DNS labels for VCNs in your tenancy. Must be an alphanumeric string that begins with a letter. The value cannot be changed.
.sp
You must set this value if you want instances to be able to use hostnames to resolve other instances in the VCN. Otherwise the Internet and VCN Resolver will not work.
