create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) in the specified
compartment. For more information, see Dynamic Routing Gateways
(DRGs).

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the DRG to reside. Notice that the DRG
doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, the DRG
attachment, or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure
which compartment to use, put the DRG in the same compartment as the
VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see
Overview of the IAM Service. For information about OCIDs, see Resource
Identifiers.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the DRG, otherwise a
default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change
it. Avoid entering confidential information.
