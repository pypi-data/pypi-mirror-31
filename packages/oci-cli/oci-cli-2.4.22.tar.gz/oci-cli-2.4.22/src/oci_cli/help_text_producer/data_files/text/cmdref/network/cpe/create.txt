create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new virtual Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE) object in the
specified compartment. For more information, see IPSec VPNs.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the CPE to reside. Notice that the CPE
doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the IPSec connection or
other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which
compartment to use, put the CPE in the same compartment as the DRG.
For more information about compartments and access control, see
Overview of the IAM Service. For information about OCIDs, see Resource
Identifiers.

You must provide the public IP address of your on-premises router. See
Configuring Your On-Premises Router for an IPSec VPN.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the CPE, otherwise a
default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change
it. Avoid entering confidential information.
