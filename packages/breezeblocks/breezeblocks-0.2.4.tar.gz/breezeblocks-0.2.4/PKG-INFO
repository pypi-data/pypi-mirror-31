        BreezeBlocks is a query abstraction layer that takes advantage of some of the
        features of the Python language more than DBAPI 2.0 modules, but provides
        more lightweight result objects and more flexible querying than many ORMs for
        the language.
        
        Most available SQL abstractions are ORMs implementing something similar to
        the Active Record pattern. A class is defined for each table,  with class-level
        properties representing the columns. Rows in the table become instances of their
        class.
        
        BreezeBlocks is designed as a query builder rather than an ORM. SQL Syntax is
        exposed in Python classes which are passed into methods for query construction.
        Query results are plain-old-data types similar to a C struct. They provide
        access to fields of the row by name, but are still compact and don't have as
        much usage overhead as most Python objects.
        
        This package is meant to help you use databases, not manage databases.
        Querying, inserting, updating, and deleting (row-level operations) are within
        scope of the project. Creating tables, views, and triggers is not.
