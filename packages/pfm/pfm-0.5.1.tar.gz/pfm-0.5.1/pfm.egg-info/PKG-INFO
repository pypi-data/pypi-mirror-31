Description: 
        Data scientists launch a Jupyter Notebook servers to tackle each machine learning task. Usually local computers are not
        enough to handle multiple machine learning tasks. And therefore data scientists do their experiments in servers launched
        in remote hosts such as EC2 instances.
        
        To connect Jupyter Notebook servers in remote hosts, we use ssh port forwarding. Port forwarding is useful since we do
        not consume resources in local PC.
        
        Unfortunately, when connecting servers in multiple remote hosts and ports numbers, we easily forget the port number or
        assign the local port number which is used in another task. Especially when there are multiple remote hosts and ssh
        servers as the following image, understanding the combinations of remote hosts and local ports are difficult.
        
        pfm manages the remote hosts and port numbers used in port forwarding. Users understand which local ports are used and
        which ports are not. Once users register the port forwarding information, pfm generates ssh parameters any time
        specifying the task name.
