Jo had locked herself in her room.
It was another one of those nights.
Her dadd was drunk and sh.outing
about something to do with the money. 10 dollars 15 minutes.
20 dollars 30 minutes. He needed it to survive.
Jo was wild. She liked climbing out the back of her window
a shaft of trepidation
She needed it to survive
444
the junction of her leg
Do you think im like a flower?..
Jo isn't anything like that. We're not some little girl
We're not afraid of the dark
Shuttering. When she was in the dark she felt alive
Jo wasn't like the other kids at school
?
10 dollars 15 minutes.
20 dollars 30 minutes.
He was coming he was always coming
Home. Her father
She could see everything in all directions
411 for information
911 for emergency
clothes gone and half the timbers burned through
(they didn't live far up) and sneaking out. She would go to
while he struggled to reach her
It was easy to get to the cheap beer and the wine
But her dad threw fits screaming if she
stole it, pretending the anger was about
In London, 9-9-9
there were people out in the underworld
that she had gotten to know
she had lifted her skirts only for hsm
Smoking it in cheap cigars, sneaking out and
Jo needed to keep screaming in the tremendous
caverns underneath the city she ran free there
Running up on empty construction sites, it made her
Feel alive. She wanted to
ache for the ecstasy. Hopping fences bolt cutters
Loosies stun guns and medical marijuana
Let her dad drink himself to death
5 to 9, 9 to 5. Jo didn't need to sleep
Very much at all.
Jo was running
She was stuck in the nose candy
on and off. She didn't care about it
though. Jo and her friends liked to rack Four lokos
grasp his dark hair and pull -- abuse me
From the deli down the street and sneak into the train
Yard they liked to tie Jo to the tracks
And watch her scream for help
her hair streaming sunlit
New York City Skyrise (cigarette ash and smog)
urination seeded sidewalks
Jo was so crazy
Jo put pills under her tongue Wednesday night
Jo was streaming 24/7 all night flying
From the tips of her cheap cigars
Jo was a fucking bastard.
I remember Jo was High Tops out curled up
into her knees on the cold metal bench
Jo didn't know how to learn a fucking lesson.
