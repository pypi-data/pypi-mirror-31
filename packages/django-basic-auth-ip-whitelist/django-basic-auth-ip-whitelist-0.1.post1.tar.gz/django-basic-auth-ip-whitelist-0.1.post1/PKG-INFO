Description: django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist
        ==============================
        
        This simple package ships middleware that lets you to set basic auth and
        IP whitelisting via settings.
        
        Use case
        --------
        
        This package has been created in mind for staging and demo sites that
        need to be completely hidden from the Internet behind a password or IP
        range.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Django 1.11 or 2.0
        -  Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The package is on
        `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist/>`__.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        In your Django settings you can configure the following settings.
        
        ``BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN`` and ``BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Credentials that you want to use with your basic authentication.
        
        ``BASIC_AUTH_WHITELISTED_IP_NETWORKS``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Set a list of network ranges (strings) compatible with Pythonâ€™s
        `ipaddress.ip_network <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.ip_network>`__
        that you want to be able to access the website without authentication
        from. It must be either a string with networks separated by comma or
        Python iterable.
        
        Example settings
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            MIDDLEWARE += [
                'baipw.middleware.BasicAuthIPWhitelistMiddleware'
            ]
            BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN = 'somelogin'
            BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD = 'greatpassword'
            BASIC_AUTH_WHITELISTED_IP_NETWORKS = [
                '192.168.0.0/28',
                '2001:db00::0/24',
            ]
        
        Advanced customisation
        ----------------------
        
        Getting IP
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you want to have a custom behaviour when getting IP, you can create a
        custom function that takes request as a parameter and specify path to it
        in the ``BASIC_AUTH_GET_CLIENT_IP_FUNCTION`` settings, e.g.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            BASIC_AUTH_GET_CLIENT_IP_FUNCTION = 'utils.ip.get_client_ip'
