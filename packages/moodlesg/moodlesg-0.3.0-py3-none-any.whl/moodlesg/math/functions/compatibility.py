"""
atan2 	Arc tangent of two variables -- pass in two values like (y, x), and you'll get the atan(y/x), adjusted to the proper quadrant. (Note: The variables are in the reverse order to atan2(x,y) in Excel) Output is radians.
bindec 	Binary to decimal
decbin 	Decimal to binary
decoct 	Decimal to octal
deg2rad 	Converts the number in degrees to the radian equivalent
expm1 	Returns exp(number) - 1, computed in a way that is accurate even when the value of number is close to zero
is_finite 	Finds whether a value is a legal finite number
is_infinite 	Finds whether a value is infinite
is_nan 	Finds whether a value is not a number
log1p 	Returns log(1 + number), computed in a way that is accurate even when the value of number is close to zero
octdec 	Octal to decimal
rad2deg 	Converts the radian number to the equivalent number in degrees
rand 	Generate a random integer
