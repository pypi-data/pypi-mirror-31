SED files (e.g., S0_A_0.sed) should be in a two-column format
[wavelength (angstroms), flux (f_lambda, NOT f_nu)] separated by spaces and
ideally be contained in their own folder(s) in this directory.

LIST files (e.g. BROWN.list) should be in a four-column format
[counter (arbitrary), shorthand name (arbitrary), filename (local path)]
separated by a space.
