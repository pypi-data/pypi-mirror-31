pandapower combines the data analysis library `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ and the power flow solver `PYPOWER <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PYPOWER>`_ to create an easy to use network calculation program
aimed at automation of analysis and optimization in power systems.

pandapower is a joint development of the research group Energy Management and Power System Operation, University of Kassel and the Department for Distribution System
Operation at the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology (IEE), Kassel.

Minimal Example
===============

A network in pandapower is represented in a pandapowerNet object, which is a collection of pandas Dataframes.
Each dataframe in a pandapowerNet contains the information about one pandapower element, such as line, load transformer etc.

We consider the following simple 3-bus example network as a minimal example:

Creating a Network
------------------------------

The above network can be created in pandapower as follows: ::
    
    import pandapower as pp
    #create empty net
    net = pp.create_empty_network() 
    
    #create buses
    b1 = pp.create_bus(net, vn_kv=20., name="Bus 1")
    b2 = pp.create_bus(net, vn_kv=0.4, name="Bus 2")
    b3 = pp.create_bus(net, vn_kv=0.4, name="Bus 3")

    #create bus elements
    pp.create_ext_grid(net, bus=b1, vm_pu=1.02, name="Grid Connection")
    pp.create_load(net, bus=b3, p_kw=100, q_kvar=50, name="Load")
  
    #create branch elements
    tid = pp.create_transformer(net, hv_bus=b1, lv_bus=b2, std_type="0.4 MVA 20/0.4 kV",
                                name="Trafo")
    pp.create_line(net, from_bus=b2, to_bus=b3, length_km=0.1, name="Line",
                   std_type="NAYY 4x50 SE")   
                   
Note that you do not have to calculate any impedances or tap ratio for the equivalent circuit, this is handled internally by pandapower according to the pandapower `transformer model <http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/trafo.html#electric-model>`_.
The `standard type library <http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/std_types.html>`_ allows comfortable creation of line and transformer elements. 

The pandapower representation now looks like this:

Running a Power Flow
------------------------------

A powerflow can be carried out with the `runpp function <http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/powerflow/ac.html>`_: ::
     
    pp.runpp(net)
    
When a power flow is run, pandapower combines the information of all element tables into one pypower case file and uses pypower to run the power flow.
The results are then processed and written back into pandapower:

For the 3-bus example network, the result tables look like this:

.. image:: http://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/pandapower_results.png
		:width: 30em
		
All other pandapower elements and network analysis functionality (e.g. optimal power flow, state estimation or short-circuit calculation) is also fully integrated into the tabular pandapower datastructure.

This minimal example is also available as a `jupyter notebook <https://github.com/lthurner/pandapower/blob/develop/tutorials/minimal_example.ipynb>`_.
