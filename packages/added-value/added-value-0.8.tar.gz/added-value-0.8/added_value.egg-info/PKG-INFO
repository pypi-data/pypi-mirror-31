Description: ===========
        Added Value
        ===========
        
        A Sphinx extension for embedded representations of Python object values into documentation.
        
        Added-value allows the *values* of Python objects to be incorporated into documentation.
        This is achieved by adding new roles and directives which refer to Python objects in the
        code being documented, much in the same way as the standard autodoc and autosummary
        extensions work.
        
        Roles
        =====
        
        The ``:repr:`` role inserts the *repr* representation of a Python object inline. For
        example, given a Python module called ``values`` containing an global ``int`` called
        ``the_answer``, you can write:
        
        ::
        
          The answer to life, the Universe and everything is :repr:`values.the_answer`.
        
        
        The ``:str:`` role inserts the *str* representation of a Python object inline. For
        example, given a Python module called ``values`` containing an global ``int`` called
        ``the_answer``, you can write:
        
        ::
        
          The answer to life, the Universe and everything is :str:`values.the_answer`.
        
        
        The ``:format:`` role inserts the *format* representation of a Python object inline. For
        example, given the Python Standard Library ``math`` module containing the ``float``
        called ``the_answer``, you can write:
        
        ::
        
          The value of pi to three decimal places is :format:`math.pi, .3f`.
        
        The optional value after the comma is a format string as used by the built-in format
        function and documented in the
        `Format Specification Mini-Language <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language>`_
        
        
        Directives
        ==========
        
        The ``.. items-table::`` directive allows a tabular representation of a Python object to be included
        in documentation.
        
        For example, given a module called ``values`` which contains a list of lists called ``month_lengths``,
        where each inner list contains a month name and the number of days in that month, a table can be
        displayed like this:
        
        ::
        
          .. items-table:: values.month_lengths
             :header: Month, Length
             :stub-columns: 1
        
        This adds a one-row header, and highlights the first 'stub' column (the month names).
