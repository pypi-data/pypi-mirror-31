F-Droid Server
==============

Server for `F-Droid <https://f-droid.org>`__, the Free Software
repository system for Android.

The F-Droid server tools provide various scripts and tools that are used
to maintain the main `F-Droid application
repository <https://f-droid.org/packages>`__. You can use these same
tools to create your own additional or alternative repository for
publishing, or to assist in creating, testing and submitting metadata to
the main repository.

For documentation, please see https://f-droid.org/docs/, or you can find
the source for the documentation in
`fdroid/fdroid-website <https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website>`__.

What is F-Droid?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source
Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it
easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways to install *fdroidserver*, they are documented on
the website:
https://f-droid.org/docs/Installing\_the\_Server\_and\_Repo\_Tools

All sorts of other documentation lives there as well.

Tests
~~~~~

There are many components to all of the tests for the components in this
git repo. The most commonly used parts of well tested, while some parts
still lack tests. This test suite has built over time a bit haphazardly,
so it is not as clean, organized, or complete as it could be. We welcome
contributions. Before rearchitecting any parts of it, be sure to
`contact us <https://f-droid.org/about>`__ to discuss the changes
beforehand.

``fdroid`` commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The test suite for all of the ``fdroid`` commands is in the *tests/*
subdir. *.gitlab-ci.yml* and *.travis.yml* run this test suite on
various configurations.

-  *tests/complete-ci-tests* runs *pylint* and all tests on two
   different pyvenvs
-  *tests/run-tests* runs the whole test suite
-  \_tests/\*.TestCase\_ are individual unit tests for all of the
   ``fdroid`` commands, which can be run separately, e.g.
   ``./update.TestCase``.

Additional tests for different linux distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These tests are also run on various distributions through GitLab CI.
This is only enabled for ``master@fdroid/fdroidserver`` because it'll
take longer to complete than the regular CI tests. Most of the time you
won't need to worry about them but sometimes it might make sense to also
run them for your merge request. In that case you need to remove `these
lines from
.gitlab-ci.yml <https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L34-35>`__
and push this to a new branch of your fork.

Alternatively `run them
locally <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/commands/README.html#gitlab-runner-exec>`__
like this: ``gitlab-runner exec docker ubuntu_lts``

buildserver
^^^^^^^^^^^

The tests for the whole build server setup are entirely separate because
they require at least 200GB of disk space, and 8GB of RAM. These test
scripts are in the root of the project, all starting with *jenkins-*
since they are run on https://jenkins.debian.net.

Drozer Scanner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a new feature under development that can scan any APK in a
repo, or any build, using Drozer. Drozer is a dynamic exploit scanner,
it runs an app in the emulator and runs known exploits on it.

This setup requires specific versions of two Python modules: *docker-py*
1.9.0 and *requests* older than 2.11. Other versions might cause the
docker-py connection to break with the containers. Newer versions of
docker-py might have this fixed already.

For Debian based distributions:

::

    apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev python-docker
