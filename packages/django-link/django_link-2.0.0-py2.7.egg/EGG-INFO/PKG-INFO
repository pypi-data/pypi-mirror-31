        Installation
        ------------
        
        #. Install or add ``django-link`` to your Python path.
        
        #. Add ``link`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        
        #. Add ``url(r'^link/', include("link.urls", namespace="link"))`` to your ``url patterns`` (only required if you intend on using the list/detail views)
        
        Note: ``django-link`` relies on ``"django.contrib.contenttypes"`` framework so
        this will need to be included in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``django-link`` provides a model to add links to your projects. It provides a ``get_absolute_url``
        method on the model which provides the url to either of these url types:
        
        #. Standard url string.
        
        #. Link to an ``object`` provided by the contenttype framework.
        
        #. Link to a pre-existing view with configurable view params.
        
        To use include the link object in the context of your view and include the following code:
        ``{{ link.get_absolute_url  }}``
        
        Or use the inclusion tag which has been provided:
        ``{% render_link slug %}``
        
        To exclude certain apps from the view name choice field add the namespace in your settings:
        ``LINK = {"excluded-viewname-choices": ["admin"]}``
