`gen-cisco` is an API and CLI to facilitate the creation of your Cisco scripts
using a YAML file. This file groups a section for each protocol including the
values to be replaced in the appropriate Cisco template.

The creation of these templates has been done during the various _CCNA_ training
courses offered by Cisco, using [Packet
Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer-download/), a network
simulation and visualization tool. Therefore, some commands may need to be
modified on real hardware.

### Installation

It's as simple as that:

```
pip install gen-cisco
```

---

### Usage

```
Usage: gen-cisco.py [OPTIONS]

  Generates Cisco scripts based on YAML files

  Examples:
    python gen-cisco.py -i examples/router.yml
    python gen-cisco.py -i examples/router.yml -o r1.txt
    python gen-cisco.py -i examples/router.yml -o r1.txt -v
    python gen-cisco.py -i examples/router.yml -o r1.txt --no-comments -v
    python gen-cisco.py -i examples/router.yml -o r1.txt --no-comments --no-headers -v
    python gen-cisco.py -i examples/router.yml -o r1.txt --no-override

Options:
  -i, --src FILENAME          The YAML file.
  -o, --dest TEXT             The name of the generated script file.
  --override / --no-override  Deletes the old file if it is overwritten.
  --comments / --no-comments  Deletes comments in the generated script.
  --headers / --no-headers    Deletes headers in the generated script.
  -v, --verbose               Outputs the final script to the console.
  --version                   Show the version and exit.
  --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

Alternatively you can run this tool using Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t gen-cisco .

# Run the image
docker run -v $(pwd):/app gen-cisco python gen-cisco.py [OPTIONS]
```

### Supported Features

Here is a list of features configurable by the scripts:

```
 basic               ➔ basic configuration for routers and switches
 eigrp               ➔ advanced distance-vector routing protocol
 etherchannel        ➔ port link aggregation technology or port-channel architecture used primarily on Cisco switches
 hsrp                ➔ Cisco redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway
 nat                 ➔ method of remapping one IP address space into another
 ospf                ➔ routing protocol for Internet Protocol networks
 rip                 ➔ one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols
 stp                 ➔ network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks
 ssh                 ➔ cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network
```
