    ----------

       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight

    -------

def bellman_ford_tree(G, source, weight='weight'):
    """
    Compute shortest path lengths and predecessors on shortest paths
    in weighted graphs using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

    The algorithm has a running time of O(mn) where n is the number of
    nodes and m is the number of edges.  It is slower than Dijkstra but
    can handle negative edge weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       The algorithm works for all types of graphs, including directed
       graphs and multigraphs.

    source: node label
       Starting node for path

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight

    Returns
    -------
    pred, dist : dictionaries
       Returns two dictionaries keyed by node to predecessor in the
       path and to the distance from the source respectively.
       Distance labels are invalid if a negative cycle exists.

    negative_cycle_end : node label
        Backtrack from this node using pred to find a negative cycle, if
        one exists; otherwise None.

    Examples
    --------

    -----

    not containing the source contains a negative cost (di)cycle, it
    will not be detected.
