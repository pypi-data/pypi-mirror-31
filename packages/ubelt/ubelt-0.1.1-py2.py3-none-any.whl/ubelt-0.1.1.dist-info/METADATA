UBelt is a "utility belt" of commonly needed utility and helper functions. 

Read the docs here: http://ubelt.readthedocs.io/en/dev-0.1.1/

 * Reusable code - Many functions in `ubelt` are simple to write yourself (e.g.   `take`, `memoize`, `ensure_unicode`), but even re-writing trivial functions takes time better spent on more important tasks. 

* Easy access - The entire `ubelt` API is exposed at the top level. While the   functions are defined in submodules, explicit imports make easy to access any function. There are also a small number of functions (e.g. `ub.odict`, `ub.ddict`, `ub.flatten`, which are aliases for `collections.OrderedDict`, `collections.DefaultDict`, and `itertools.chain.from_iterable`, respectively) that are essentially aliases for functions already in Python's standard library. I found myself using these functions so much that I wanted easier access to them, thus they are included in `ubelt`.

* Extra batteries - Python's standard library is "batteries included" and   provides great APIs for a variety of tasks. UBelt both extends these batteries and provides simplified interfaces to others. 

 * Copy paste - It is often not desirable to add extra dependencies to code.   While I encourage installation and use of this module, I realize that option   is not always feasible. Most (but not all) functions were also written in a   way where they can be copy and pasted into your packages own utility library   without needing to add a dependency on `ubelt`.
