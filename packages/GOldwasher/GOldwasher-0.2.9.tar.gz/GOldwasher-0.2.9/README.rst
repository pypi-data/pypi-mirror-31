GOldwasher
==========

GOldwasher is a light wrapper for the R package 
**topGO** (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html). The 
function of GOldwasher is limited to the calculation of GO term enrichment 
(via elimFisher algorithm) of target gene lists and also the generation their 
respective GO subgraph images (via 
**Graphviz** (http://www.graphviz.org/) - Graph Visualization Software) 
subsuming their annotations. These elements are then incorporated together into 
html a single report file per input list which can then be  interactively 
explored. The purpose and focus of this module is to facilitate batch processing of 
several gene lists.

----------

**Current release:** *0.2.9 (alpha)*

Provides basic functionality and basic documentation. Methods and functions 
are working if the input does not deviate from expected (none to little input 
sanitization) but they haven't been extensively tested.  

----

**TODO:**
  
- Write (proper) tests
- Improve documentation
- Re-think R interface mod
- Make OBOe mod independent of ontology mod
- Extend functionality (select and compare subsets)




Installation
------------

.. code::

  # pip install GOldwasher-0.2.8.tar.gz

or

.. code::

  # pip install GOldwasher


**Requirements**:
The non-python dependencies are:

- **graphviz** http://www.graphviz.org/
- **GO OBO file** (http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology)

R packages (and inherently **R**):

- **topGO** http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html 
- **jsonlite** https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html

These packages/file should be installed/downloaded for GOldwasher to work. All 
other python dependencies should be automatically resolved by pip.




Usage
-----

GOldwasher can be used as a module, making use of its methods, or more easily
it can conveniently be used from its command tool 'goldpanner'

.. code::

    goldpanner [-h] -c CONFIG -i INPUTDIR
                  {ANNOT,ENRICH,DAG,REPORT}

e.g.:
 
.. code::

  goldpanner -c settings.ini -i lists/ REPORT

-**c** ini file with general settings using the following structure:

    *[meta]*
    *[vars]*

    alpha = 0.01  

    organism = phaeodactylum


    *[sources]*

    functionalDesc = /path/to/tabseparedfile/withIDtabFunctionalDescription.txt

    g_map = /path/to/mappings/identifier2GOaccessions.txt

    obofile = /path/to/go-basic.obo


    #linkinsets = /path/to/custom/organisms.json

**[vars]**

**alpha** - significance level  

**organism** - name of the organism (as key name on 'organisms.json')

**[sources]**

**functionalDesc** 

    path to tab-separated file holding a column of identifiers and their matching functional descriptors. 

**g_map** 

    path to tab-separated file holding a column of identifiers and a second column with their associated GO term accession numbers separated by commas.            

    e.g.:

    .. code::

        Phatr3_J43587.t1  GO:0006396,GO:0005622,GO:0005515 

**obofile** 

    path to the GO ontology obo file. It can be downloaded from: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/go-basic.obo


**linkinsets**

    If using organisms other than *Arabidopis thaliana* or *Phaeodactylum tricornutum* uncomment this variable and set it as the path to the customized 'organisms.json'. By default no cross-links are generated for unknown/unset organisms.


**-i** directory with the target lists.


  **COMMANDS**:

    ANNOT - annotates identifiers lists with respective available functional descriptors.

    ENRICH - performs GO term enrichment on the annotated lists.

    DAG - generates color-coded GO graph image (svg format) from (topGO) enrichment results.

    REPORT - generates an interactive html GO enrichment report for each list on the input directory.  

....

**optional argument**:

**-o** output directory (can be used with all commands except ENRICH)
